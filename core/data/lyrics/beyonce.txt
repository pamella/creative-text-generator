I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac,
 
gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good
Hahaha!
[Chorus: Beyoncé + 
JAY-Z
]
I'm nice right now… Hold up!
That D'USSÉ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talkin' about you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin', watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you, right now
Daddy, I want you

Bitch, I'm back by popular demand
Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess
Paparazzi, catch my fly and my cocky fresh
I'm so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress (Stylin')
I'm so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces
My daddy Alabama, momma Louisiana

I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros
I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils
Earned all this money, but they never take the country out me

El Camino with the seat low, sippin' Cuervo with no chaser
Sometimes I go off (I go off), I go hard (I go hard)
Get what's mine (Take what's mine), I'm a star (I'm a star)
'Cause I slay (Slay), I slay (Hey), I slay (Okay), I slay (Okay)

Golly, look at that water, boy, oh Lord
Let me hear you say, "Hey, Ms. Carter!" (Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Say, "Hey, Ms. Carter!" (Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Give me some!
See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm looking, babe
Boy, this all for you just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
(How it's looking, babe?)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's looking babe
Tell me how it's looking babe, looking babe
Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "Speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor
Beyoncé, Beyoncé?
Are you happy to be in Paris? Are you happy to be in Paris?
Beyoncé, Beyoncé? Beyoncé!
Driver, roll up the partition, please
I don't need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara running, red lipstick smudged
Oh, he so horny, yeah, he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky'd all on my gown
Oh, there, daddy, daddy didn’t bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby, we better slow it down
We ain't even gon' make it to this club
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kind of girl you like, girl you like
The kinda girl you like is right here with me
(Right here with me, right here with me, right here with me)
Driver, roll up the partition fast (Hey)
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Over there I swear I saw them cameras flash
Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blasting
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, we’ll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping, trying not to crash
Oh, there, daddy, daddy, now you ripped my fur
Oh, baby, baby, be sweating out my hair
Hello!
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe ?
Le sexe, je veux dire : l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça ?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe ?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent
Bzz-bzz-bzz-bzz-bzz-bzzwop
I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my, oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big, do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl?
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup?
On my mind, up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away, all that I can think of is
We should get married, we should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to
Do it big do it all for a good girl
From eight until late, I think ‘bout you
You own my nights, I don’t know what to do, do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing got way too deep and we should
Wassup...
(Pull up on you) I gotta pull up on you
You gon' make me have to pull up on you
Don’t go ghost on me, I'ma go Thriller on you, I'ma just (Pull up on you)
I'ma let my hands do the talking when I see you baby girl
I miss feeling on you,(Pull up on you) I miss everything that's real about you
And that's everything about you that's just how I feel about you (Pull up on you)
I been about you and I’m still about you but
We ain't finished talking (Pull up on you)
I told you you don’t need to worry about them bitches
All them fives need to listen when the ten is talking (Pull up on you)
'Cause they don’t wanna see you happier than them
And girl you swear they all ya friends and that's been a problem (Pull up on you)
You the one they hate, just come with that
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a running back
But that nigga came running back
(Pull up on you) And you tell me that you’re done with that
And I believe it's true
All I’m really asking for is you
Long as you know who you belong to
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you
Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se
Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
I hop up out my bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
I ain't sorry
He trying to roll me up (I ain't sorry)
I ain't picking up (I ain't sorry)
Headed to the club (I ain't sorry)
I ain't thinking 'bout you (I ain't sorry)
Me and my ladies sip my D'USSÉ cups
I don't give a fuck, chucking my deuces up
Suck on my balls, pause, I had enough (Sorry, I ain't sorry)
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout
Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him, boy, bye (Sorry, I ain't sorry)
Tell him, boy, bye, boy, bye, middle fingers up
Sorry, I ain't sorry (You)
Sorry, I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry
No, no, hell nah
Now you wanna say you're sorry
Now you wanna call me crying
Now you gotta see me wilding
Now I'm the one that's lying
And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding
(You interrupting my grinding)
Wave it in his face, tell him, boy, bye (Bye) (Sorry, I ain't sorry)
Tell him, boy, bye (Bye), boy, bye (Bye)
Middle fingers up, I ain't thinking 'bout you
Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
Today, I regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them fucking excuses
I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is
I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
(Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy...
You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb
I pray to catch you whispering (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me (Pray you)
I'm praying you catch me
What are you doing, my love?
I found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
True love never has to hide
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
Trade your broken wings for mine
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime, oh
Seen your scars and kissed your crime
So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Our love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light, oh
If you get deep, you touch my mind
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes, oh
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes
So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Boy, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy
How I missed you, my love

We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (

Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (
Dum-dah-de-da
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (
Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are

The judges give champion Skeleton Crew 4 stars, a perfect score
The challenger, Girls' TYME, receives... 3 stars
Skeleton Crew, champions once again
Congratulations, we'll see you next week
Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out
Ooh
Halo, oh oh
Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new
I'ma walk, I'ma march on the regular
Painting white flags blue
Lord, forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'ma rain, I'ma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new
I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away," oh
May the last one burn into flames
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose! Yeah
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom, too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters
Tell the tide, "Don't move"
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Call me bulletproof
Lord, forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new
Freedom, cut me loose!
Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction (Come on)
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me, like yeah
Open correctional gates in higher desert (Yeah)
Open our mind as we cast away oppression (Yeah)
Open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh, father, can you hear me?
Hear me out
I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to pull myself up. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade
.
Oh na na na
Don't hurt yourself
Who the fuck do you think I is?
You ain't married to no average bitch, boy
You can watch my fat ass twist, boy
As I bounce to the next dick, boy
And keep your money, I got my own
Keep a bigger smile on my face being alone
Bad motherfucker, God complex
Motivate your ass, call me Malcolm X
Yo operator, or innovator
Fuck you, hater, you can't recreate her, no, nuh-uh
You'll never recreate her, no, hell no
We just got to let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, baby
You just got to let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, babe
When you hurt me, you hurt yourself
When you diss me, you diss yourself
Don't hurt yourself (Don't hurt yourself)
When you love me, you love yourself
Love God herself
I am the dragon breathing fire
Beautiful mane, I'm the lion
Beautiful man, I know you're lying
I am not broken, I'm not crying, I'm not crying
You ain't trying hard enough
You ain't loving hard enough
You don't love me deep enough
We not reaching peaks enough
Blindly in love, I fucks with you
'Til I realize I'm just too much for you
I'm just too much for you
Hey baby, who the fuck do you think I is?
I smell that fragrance on your Louis knit, boy
Just give my fat ass a big kiss, boy
Tonight I'm fucking up all your shit, boy
Try not to hurt yourself
When you play me, you play yourself
Don't play yourself
When you lie to me, you lie to yourself
You only lying to yourself (Don't hurt yourself)

Uh, this is your final warning (Don't hurt yourself)
You know I give you life (Don't hurt yourself)

Yes, mass appeal
Don't take your eyes, don't take your eyes off it

Do you, do you wanna touch me, baby?
Grab a hold, don't let go
Let me know, that you, ready
I just wanna show you now, slow it down, go around
You rock hard, I rock steady
And rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, over me
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls
I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass, when you put it in your face
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create rockets and waterfalls
So rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Send all your sins all over me babe, over me
Hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady
Rock, hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady
Don't you know that I give you the loving if you need it
I give you my word, you can believe it
Your love feels like all four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason, swimming in my love, your love lifting
Higher, harder
Got me screaming to the Lord, boy
Kiss me, pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, rock it 'til the water falls
Damn
I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy, daddy

All up in your face?

Ooh, my shit's so good that it ain't even right

Hell yeah, you the shit

Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
She's stacking money, money everywhere she goes
You know, pesos out of Mexico
De uno, commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up, she professional
She mixing up that Ace with that Hennessy
She love the way it tastes, that's her recipe
Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy (Oh no)
She already made enough, but she'll never leave
She works for the money, she work for the money
From the start to the finish
And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar
And she worth every minute
She work for the money
She stack her money, money everywhere she goes
She got that Sake, her Yamazaki straight from Tokyo
Oh baby, you know, she got them commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up 'cause she professional
[Chorus: Beyoncé & 
The Weeknd
Goddamn (Goddamn, babe)

Stars in her eyes

She grinds day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Work from Friday to Sunday, oh
She gon' slang
She too smart to crave material things
She pushing herself day and night
She fights and she sweats those sleepless nights
But she don't mind, she loves the grind
Works from Friday to Sunday, yeah, yeah
Too smart to crave material things
Stacking her paper, stacking her cake up
Works from Friday to Sunday
(Know just what to do to make you love me)
And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar (Love me)
Ooh, boy, I'll make you feel
You'll always come back to me
Come back, come back
Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm
'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought
Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed, I'm movin' on
I always been committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me
If I wasn't B, would you still feel me?
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack
I'm so tough, wassup?
And you, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought
You, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought
Ms. Third Ward, your first question:
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well my aspiration in life would be... to be happy
Mama said, "You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters"
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery
Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says thinner is better
Just another stage, pageant the pain away
We try to fix something
It's the soul that needs the surgery
Ain’t got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery
(It's my soul that needs surgery)
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful girl
When you're alone all by yourself
And you're lying in your bed
Reflection stares right into you
Are you happy with yourself?
You stripped away the masquerade
The illusion has been shed
Yeah, yes (Ah, ah, ah)
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release
Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I found the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You should have listened
There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago
Oh, I'm screamin' out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or turned
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen
Listen. I am alone at a crossroads
I followed the voice you gave to me
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't
A melody I start, but I will complete
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own, my own
"Flight controllers here looking very carefully at the situation
Obviously a major malfunction"
Your love is bright as ever
Even in the shadows
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Your heart is glowing
And I’m crashing into you
Baby, love me lights out
In the darkest night hour (In the darkest night hour)
Search through the crowd (Search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I've given you everything
(XO)
You can turn my lights out
We don’t have forever
Baby, daylight’s wasting
You better kiss me
Before our time has run out
Nobody sees what we see
They’re just hopelessly gazing
Baby, take me
I'll search through the crowd (I'll search through the crowd)
I'll give you everything
I love you like XO
You love me like XO
You kill me boy XO
All that I see
Give me everything
Part 1: Ghost
(The winner is Beyoncé Knowles: female pop vocalist!)
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston
And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder:
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Soul not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so, mmm
Part 2: Haunted
It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm onto you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, I'm on to you
Onto you, I'm onto you
You want me? I walk down the hallway
You like it? The bedroom's my runway
Slap me! I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay
I know if I'm onto you, you must be onto me
It's what we see
Onto you, you must be onto me
You must be onto me
On to you, I'm on to you
Me, me, me
I'm in my penthouse half-naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling that's because I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no"
Take it one step further, freakum dress out my closet
Yoncé fillin' out this skirt, I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat, boy, you been hanging out at night
Tonight I'm staying out 'til tomorrow
Dancing on them tables ain't got no cares, no sorrow
I ran into my ex, said what up to his besties
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas, don't be jealous
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous, I'm just human, don't judge me
Yee-haw
Texas, Texas (Ooh) Texas
Came into this world, daddy's little girl
And Daddy made a soldier out of me (Ooh)
Daddy made me dance and Daddy held my hand (Ooh)
And Daddy liked his whiskey with his tea
And we rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
And oh, that's when he gave to me
With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone, "Here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around"
Yee, woo
Yee-haw (Woo)
Daddy made me fight, it wasn't always right
But he said, "Girl, it's your second amendment" (Ooh)
He always played it cool, but Daddy was no fool
And right before he died, he said, "Remember..."
That's when Daddy looked at me
With his gun, with his head held high, he told me not to cry
My daddy said shoot (Yee)
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Yee-haw)
'Cause he held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
And he told me when he's gone, "Here's what you do
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Woo)
Ooh (Woo)
Ooh (Yee)
Ooh (Yee-haw)
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said, "Baby girl, he's playing you, he's playing you" (Ooh)
He said, "Baby girl, he's playing you, he's playing you (Ooh)
'Cause when trouble comes in town and men like me come around"
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Yee)
"'Cause when trouble comes to town and men like me come around"
(Good job, Bey)
I fought for you
The hardest, it made me the strongest
So tell me your secrets
I just can't stand to see you leaving
But Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home
We laughed at the darkness
So scared that we lost it
We stood on the ceilings
You showed me love was all you needed
So go on go home
Padre Nuestro
Que estas en el cielo
Santificado sea tu Nombre
Venga tu reino
Hagase tu voluntad
En la tierra como en el cielo
Amen
Boy!
Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling
Still the one I need, I will always be with you
Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go
Say it real loud if you fly
If you leave me, you're out of your mind
My baby is a ten
We dressing to the nine
He pick me up, we eight
Make me feel so lucky, seven
He kiss me in his six
We be making love in five
Still the one I do this four
I'm trying to make us three

There's up's and downs in this love
Got a lot to learn in this love
Through the good and the bad, still got love
Dedicated to the one I love, hey
Still love the way he talk, still love the way I sing
Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain
Still all up on each other, ain't a damn thing change
My girls can't tell me nothing, I'm gone in the brain
I'm all up under him like it's cold, winter time
All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time
Do whatever that it takes, he got a winner's mind
Give it all to him, meet him at the finish line
Me and my boo in my boo's coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it
Yup, I put it on him, it ain't nothing that I can't do
Yup, I buy my own, if he deserve it, buy his shit too
All up in the store, shorty, tricking if I want to
All up in the store, shorty, fly as we want to
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Damn, I think I love that boy, do anything for that boy (Boy)
Now I'll never be the same, you and me until the end
Me and my boo in the coupe lip locking
All up in the back because the chicks keep flocking
All that gossip in ten years, stop it
London speed it up, Houston rock it
Make me feel so lucky seven
I'm out that H-town
Coming, coming down

And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And, it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you

Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking

When I talk to my friends so quietly
("Who he think he is?") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew

Hehehe! Yeah, B!
Talk yo' shit! Hehe (Partner, let me upgrade you)
How you gon' upgrade me?
What's higher than number one?
You know I used to beat that block
Now I be's the block (Partner, let me upgrade you)
I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a leash though
I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me
Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, you need me
This ain't a shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?
You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (That's a good look)
And I'mma help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look, ladies that's a good look)
Believe me
When you're in them big meetings for the mills (That's a good look)
It take me just to compliment the deals (That's a good look)
And anything you cop, I'll split the bill
Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you
Switch your neck ties to purple labels
Upgrade you (I can) up, (Can I?) up, (Let me) upgrade you
(Partner, let me upgrade you)
Partner, let me upgrade you, flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things and
I can do for you, what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equals
Still play my part and let you take the lead role, believe me
I'll follow, this could be easy
I'll be the help, whenever you need me (You need me)
I see your hustle with my hustle, I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you
I can help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look, ladies, that's a good look)
Anything you cop, I'll split the bill
Heu, believe me, I can upgrade you

(Partner, let me upgrade you)  (Uh huh!)
I be the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do
It's big balling, baby, when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me, they watching and we just yachting
Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (Hehe)
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
Now you my project celebrity
I keep ya name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star, but unless you're flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me
Introduce you to some new things, and
Audemars Piguet watch, dimples in ya necktie
Hermes briefcase, Cartier tie clips
Silk-lined blazers, diamond creamed facials
VVS cuff links, six-star pent suites
Partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partna, partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Let me, let me, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partna, partna, partna, let me upgrade ya (Huh!)
When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward
(Superpower)
A subtle power
A tough love
Like a shark
Ooh, like a bear
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
'Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down
And just like you I can be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there: tough love (Superpower)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls, it's a superpower (Superpower)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together we got plenty superpower
Oh, like a shark
Ooh, too much to bear
But together we got plenty power
Nothing I know can break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying
Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
No I'm not an angel either, but at least I'm trying
I know I drive you crazy, but would you rather that I be a machine
Who doesn't notice when you late or when you're lying
I love you even more than who I thought you were before
Tell me, do you wanna ride?
Ride around, ride around
Ride around
Will you ride around with that H-town?
If there's candles near your bed, no need for a spell
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell
First, both of my legs go back on your head
And whatever you want
Yeah, baby, I'll bet it comes true
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no...
Bring the beat in
Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me, I just melt away
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts) But I know
(It's gonna take a little work) Oh
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Baby, baby, I can feel the wind whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
Boy, your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again
Come on, baby, it's you (It's you)
Ooh, baby!
[
Chorus 2
You're the one I need, you're the only thing I see
You're the one that always call
When I need you, baby, everything stops
Baby, you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only one I see
You're the one I always call
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're the one that I need
Baby, baby, it's you
You're the one that always calls
When I need you everything stops
Finally you put my love on top
I wish I could believe you, then I'd be alright
But now everything you told me really don't apply to the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy, once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment
Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another who didn't mean a thing
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you, and I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you, I know it ain't the same
I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can
And I tried, and I tried to forget this
I'll always remember feeling like I was no good
Like I couldn't do it for you like your mistress could
Loved you more than another, more than my own life
But that part of me I gave you, it was sacrificed
But I'm too damn full of resentment
I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been riding with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?
I know you're probably thinking, "What's up with B?"
I been crying for too long, what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm crying, can't stop crying
Can't stop crying
You could've told me you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes and see she's had half of me
How could you lie?
What goes around, comes back around (Hey, my baby!)
What goes around, comes back around (My, my, my baby!)
I say, what goes around comes back around (Hey, my baby!)
What goes around comes back around
There was a time I thought
That you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been out of my mind
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, so baby, good looking out
I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
I bet it sucks to be you right now
So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there
To I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass, and baby, yes, I saw the real you
I'm so over you, baby, good looking out
I said, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now
I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time
Another world, another life
Thank God, I found the good in goodbye
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the best thing you never had
Ooh, best thing you never had
Ooh, I will never be the best thing you never had
What goes around, comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)

And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond

And I don’t have a reason to be, if I can’t be with you
And I don't need air in my lungs, if I can’t sing your song
No, I don’t need hands if I don’t get to keep you warm
And I don’t really need myself, if I don't need you
'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I can see with you
And I live so I can die with you
And I don’t really need these fingers, if I don’t get to touch your spine
Well, I don’t need these legs, if I ain’t walking by your side
And I don’t really need to be if I can’t be with you

Swirling on you, babe
In my mind all I can think about is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past and a chance to make this love last
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah
I'll be swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on my babe
Watch me p-pop it, p-pop it for you, baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you, baby
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch me roll it, baby
Wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch me
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
Here you go, trippin'
Everything is cool between us Bey
I told you that
Out on the road with my people, just doin' what I gotta do
There’s nothing going that shouldn't be goin' on
You gotta trust me, Ma
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I moved on
Because I realized I got
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend
So controlling, you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Now that it's over, stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time, but now I am strong
(Got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Hey, I know that I will never disappoint myself
I've cried
Yeah, -eah
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoo-ooh
Whoo-ooh-ooh!
I have cried so many times
I can't regret time spent with you
Oh! I know that I will never disappoint myself
If you've cried a thousand times
Ladies, you will survive!
Yeah! You hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
I can see the sun shine
I got me, myself, and I
I remember being young, tough, brave
I knew what I needed
I was spending all my nights and days laid back day dreaming
Look at me I’m a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town
Now betcha I run this
Cause I put it down like that, d-down like that
And I’m making all these racks, a-all these racks
And I’m moving round like that, r-round like that
When I do it I don’t look back, d-don’t look back
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
They love the way I walk
‘Cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk ’cause I ain’t pretending
It took a while, now I understand just where I’m goin'
I know the world and I know who I am, It's 'bout time I show it
I can be bad if I want
I can say what I want
I can live fast if I want
I can go slow all night long
I'm a grown woman, and I know that I got it
I'm a grown woman, ain't got no room in my pockets
I'm a grown woman, look down, got you so excited
I really want to know if you got it like that
Cause I got a cute face and my booty so fat
Go girl, she got that bomb, that bomb
That girl, can get whatever she wants
That girl, she got that tight, that tight
Them boys, will do whatever what she likes
(African Vocals)
She was lost in so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
There for the grace of God go, I
I found Heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down
You are my Heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing Ave Maria
Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans
Suddenly hit you and then you realize
It's out of your hands, baby, you got to understand
Let the mother-fucking beat build in this bitch
About that
I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you
Why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you around
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?
The words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean 'em
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to
It don't matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
Wanna be with you, but you're away (But you're away)
I love you
Baby, I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation, in connection to the sun
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am the seed
With you and God who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free
And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
'Cause years before, I became who I am
Baby, you were my man
I know it ain't easy, easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny, I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife, and I see my whole future in your eyes
The thought of all my love for you, sometimes makes me wanna cry
I realize all my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side
Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good, it hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love, to hold, to feel, to breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love
What they say?
The world
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
You make me happy
This you can bet, yeah
It's clear right beside me, yeah
And I won't forget
And I really love you
You should know
I wanna make sure I'm right, boy
Before I let go
Now, we had our good times
That we can say
We hurted each other, yeah
And, boy, it's a shame
I won't be foolish, no
I wanna know
I wanna make sure I'm bright, boy
Yeah, uh, yeah, yeah
You know, I thank God sun rises and shines on you
You know there's nothing, nothin', nothin' I would not do, oh
Before I let you go, woah
I would never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never
Let you go before I go
I pull up to Coachella (Pull up)
In boots with the goose feathers (Pull up)
I brought the squad with me (I got the squad)

Cross your legs, turn around and clap
Shuffle to the left, let's glide now
Ooh, drop it down, drop it down low, low
Low, low, low to the floor, floor
Bring it up, clap, then roll, roll
Step on 'em, step on 'em, step on 'em, step
Step on 'em, kick on 'em, stomp, then you step
Swag the right, surf the left
Work the middle 'til it hurt a little
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, oh
Before I let, before I let, b-b-before I let go
Aw baby, how you doin'?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh?
Some women were made...
But me, myself?
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
And, uh
What's more special than 
you
?
You feel me?
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie
It's too big (Big)
It's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong)
It won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much)
It's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Usually I'm humble
Right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know
I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile,
 or maybe my eyes?
Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda something like me
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego
But, he loves my big ego
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I, I can back it up
I can back it up
Such a huge ego (Such a huge ego)
But, I love his big ego
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, you ain't know?
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano...
Whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woo...
Oh, oh-oh-oh
See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls
Posted in the back, got my fangs and my grill
G's up tell me how I'm looking babe
Boy this all for you just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking babe
I do this all for you baby just take aim
How it's looking, how it's looking babe
Drop the bass mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "speed it up", I just go slower
Ya man ain't never seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off your tongue
'Cus when he wanna smash I'll just write another one
If I ain't got nothing, I got you
If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn
'Cause I got it with you
I don't know much about algebra, but I know 1+1 equals 2
And it's me and you
That's all we'll have when the world is through
'Cause baby, we ain't got nothing without love
Darling, you got enough for the both of us
So come on, baby, make love to me
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go, make love to me
So when the world's at war, let our love heal us all
Right now, baby, make love to me
We, me, me, me
Oh, make love to me
Hey, I don't know much about guns, but I
I've been shot by you, hey
And I don't know when I'm gon' die, but I hope
That I'm gon' die by you, hey
I don't know much about fighting, but I
I know I will fight for you, hey
Just when I ball up my fist, I realize
I'm laying right next to you
Baby, we ain't got nothing but love
And darling, you got enough for the both of us
Ooh, make love to me
Help me let down my guard
Make love to me, me, me, me, me
Oh, oh, make love to me, me, me, me, me
I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time
Know there was something that meant something that I left behind
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget
I was here
I lived, I loved
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I wanna say I lived each day, until I die
And know that I meant something in, somebody's life
The hearts I have touched, will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see
I did, I’ve done everything that I wanted
I just want them to know
That I gave my all, did my best
Brought someone some happiness
Left this world a little better just because
I wanna leave my mark so everyone will know
I lived (I lived), I loved
I did (I did), I've done
I lived (I lived)
I loved (I loved)
I did, I've done
You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still, you live inside of me
So tell me how is that?
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, you're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
'Cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl
Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now, I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you've got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one
And yes, there are times when I hate you
But I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you
I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day
Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away
Away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh, ohh, ohh
I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't wanna a broken heart
Don't want to take a breath without my baby
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
Broken-hearted girl no, no
(Turn the lights on)
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (Cover the skies)
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey)
I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a-a diva
I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a a diva
I'm a, I'm a a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a a di...
Na-na-na, diva is a female version of a hustla, of a hustla, of a, of a hustla
Stop the track, lemme state facts
I told you, gimme a minute and I'll be right back
Fifty million 'round the world and they say that I couldn't get it
I done got so sick and filthy with Benjis, I can't spend it
How you gon' be talkin' shit? You act like I just got up in it
Been the number one diva in this game for a minute
I know you read the paper - the one that they call the Queen
Every radio 'round the world know me 'cause that's where I be (first!)
When he pull up, wanna pop my hood up
Bet he better have a six-pack in the cooler
Gettin' money, diva's gettin' money
If you ain't gettin' money, then you ain't got nothin' fo' me
Tell me somethin', (Tell me somethin')
Where yo boss at (Where yo' boss at?)
Where my ladies up in here that like to talk back? (That like to talk back)
I wanna see her (I wanna see her)
I'd like to meet ya (I'd like to meet her)
What you say? (Not to me)
She ain't no diva (She ain't no diva)...
Since 15 in my stilettos, been struttin' in this game
"What's yo age?" was the question they ask when I hit the stage
I'm a diva, best believe her, you see how she gettin' paid?
She ain't callin' him to greet her, don't need him, her bed's made
This is a stick-up, stick-up (I need them bags, all that money)
We're gonna stick-up, stick-up (You see them ask, "Where that money?")
All my ladies get it up, I see you, I do the same;
Take it to another level, no passengers on my plane
Stick-up, stick-up (You see the mask, "Where that money?")
Na-na-na, diva is a female version of a hustla, of a hustla, of a, of a hustla...
I'm a, I'm a-a diva, I'm a, I'm a-a diva, I'm a, I'm a-a diva.....
(Hey)
If you feel insignificant
You better think again
Better wake up because
You're part of something way bigger
Not just a speck in the universe
Not just some words in a bible verse
You are the living word
Ah, you're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you‚ bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
But now we see it
And it ain't no secret‚ no
Understand that truth about that question in your soul
Look up‚ don't look down, then watch the answers unfold
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print
Uh‚ take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent
Rise (Rise), the spirit is teachin'
No, I'm not just preachin'‚ I'm takin' my own advice
Let Mama let you know (Let you know)
Mama's still tryin'
I can't get no days off
I don't get no days off
Truly, I'm feelin' it
I had to say that thing twice (Twice)
Tryin' to be a good wife
Still really hard, I can't lie
But I promised you I would fight, so I fight
If you're feelin' frustrated and (Oh)
You're sinkin', I'm jumpin' in (Oh)
Forgiveness is key because
We're fightin' something way bigger
You'll never lose, we are winners
I'll be the roots, you'll be the tree
Pass on the fruit that was given to me
Legacy, ah
We're part of something way bigger
(Yeah) Bigger
Bigger than you, bigger than we
Legacy, oh
Let love be the water
I pour into you and you pour into me
There ain't no drought here
Bloom into our actual powers
I'll be your sanctuary
You just don't know it yet
No matter how hard it gets
You got my blood in ya
And you're gonna rise
Bigger than you, bigger than me
Bigger than the picture they paint us to be, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Understand that truth about that question in your soul (Bigger)
Look up, don't look down, then watch the answers unfold (Bigger)
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print (Bigger)
Take the pen and rewrite it
Rise, the spirit is teachin'
No, I'm not just preachin', I'm takin' my own advice

So don't you fight it
I love to see you walk into the room
Body shining, lighting up the place

'Cause they know you know just what to say
The way that you protect your friends
Baby, I respect you for that
And when you grow, you take everyone you love along
I love that shit
Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key

And if I need you, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice
Hello (Hello, hello)

She gon' take everything I own
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
She go profit everything I taught
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gon' choke?
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on
(Oh)
He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)
But she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call
Time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, baby?
Is that the price I that pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?
(See all the things, see all the things)

(UH-huh, ready, uh-Huh)
Let's go get 'em 
(Uh-huh)
C'mon (C'mon)
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B. (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B., she about to sting, stand back
Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Seeing, things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin' past me almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it
Yes, Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl you should already know
It's H-O,
 light up the dro
'Cause you gonna need help tryna study my, bounce
Flow, blow, what's the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
Thats a no-go, my dough keep the 
scales tippin'
Like 4-4s,
like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one of one, nothin' after me
No Déjà Vu, just me and my- (OH!)
Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having Déjà Vu?
Something told me it was over (Yeah)
When I saw you and her talking deep
Something deep down in my soul said cry girl (cry, cry)
When I saw you and that girl walking around whoo ooh
I would rather, I would rather go blind boy
Then to see you walk away from me child naw naw whoo ooh
So you see I love you so much that I don't wanna watch you leave me baby
Most of all I just don't
I just don't wanna be free now whoo ooh, Woo oh
I w
as just, I was just, I was
 just sitting here thinking of your kiss
And your warm embrace yeah
When a reflection in a glass that I held to my lips now baby
Revealed these tears that are on my face whoo ooh
And baby, and baby, baby I'd rather be blind boy
Then to see you walk away
Walk away from me yeah
And baby, baby, baby I'd rather be blind boy
Walk away from me
I tried to change
Closed my mouth more
Tried to be soft, prettier
Less... awake
Fasted for 60 days
Wore white
Abstained from mirrors
Abstained from sex
Slowly did not speak another word
And that time my hair I grew past my ankles
I slept on a mat on the floor
I swallowed a sword
I levitated
Into the basement
Confessed my sins
And was baptized in a river
Got on my knees and said, "Amen"
And said, "I mean"
I whipped my own back
And asked for dominion at your feet
I threw myself into a volcano
I drank the blood and drank the wine
I sat alone in begged and bent at the waist for God
I crossed myself in thought
I saw the devil
I grew thickened skin on my feet
I bathed in bleach
And plugged my menses with the pages from the holy book
But still inside me coiled deep was the need to know
Are you cheating?
Are you cheating on me?
You know I hate sleeping alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby, that was a long time ago
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
On top of you not callin' me back
You see, I bet you think it's all on track
And you actin' like it's all o' that
Let's go, let's go little kitty cat
I think it's time to go
Let's go little kitty cat
He don't want no mo'
Quite frankly: no more givin' it
I'm not feelin' it
It's like we at two places, but different paces
We in trouble, but you won't meet me at the bridge
It hurts, it feels deserted
Did you forget where your heart lives?
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body?
Acting like I'm not nobody
You gon' make me call somebody
You would rather go and party
Somehow, somewhere I'll be naughty
(Let me show you how to get there)
Take a left to compassion (Lights will be flashin')
Keep straight and you'll see the sun right there
Affection (You're in the wrong direction)
If I get caught, see, it just seems that you don't care
You don't want my body, body
But you said that you would soon be home (said that you would soon be home)
On top of you not calling me back
I'm not feeling it, I'm not feeling it
I'm taking back the things I got from you, you
And that includes my sweet little nookie too, too
Let's go, let's go, let's go little kitty cat (Kitty cat)
He don't want you anymore, no (Uh, uh, uh)
He don't want you anymore, no
(Ooh, ooh)
Got diamonds on my neck
Got diamonds on my records
Since 16, I was coming down reppin' Texas
How you gon' neglect this? You is just a hot mess
You can call Tyrone, you ain't gots to lie Craig
What about by my body, body?
I'm in the house all alone, you rather go and party?
Acting like I'm nobody
Let's go, little kitty cat
He ain't want no mo'
No mo' getting' it, I'm not feelin' it
If the storm comes
If we burn up
If the wells run dry
You're my reason
To believe in
Another life
If it all ends
And it's over
If the sky falls fire
Best believe me
You will see me
On the other side
If we wake up
Lose our patience
Or even lose our lives, oh
I'll feel lucky
To say that you've been
A friend of mine

I told you how you hurt me, baby
But you don't care
Now I'm crying and deserted, baby
Ain't nobody tell me this is love
When you're immune to all my pain
I need you to tell me this is love
You don't care?
Well, that's okay
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
Ever since you knew your power, you made me cry
And now everytime our love goes sour, you won't sympathize
You see these tears falling down to my ears
I swear, you like when I'm in pain, yeah
I try to tell you all my fears
You still don't care?
That's okay
Boy, maybe if you cared enough
I wouldn't have to care so much
What happened to our trust?
Now you're just given up
You used to be so in love
Now you don't care no more
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, whoa
I still care
Oh Oh Oh I, Oh Oh Oh I
If I wrote a book about were we stand
Then the title of my book would be "Life With Superman." That's how you make me feel
I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same
I see it everyday in all the things you do
In all the things you say
You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
You are my rock, you're everything i need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me
I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do.`
I love to rock with you
Oh Oh Oh I
If I were to try to count the ways to make me smile
I'd run out of fingers before i run out of timeless
Things to talk about
Sugar you keeps it going on
Make me wanna keep my loving strong
Make me wanna try my best to give you what you want
And what you need
Give you my whole heart
Not just a little piece
More than a minimum, I'm talking everything
More than a single wish  I'm talking every dream
If there's options, i don't want them. They're not worth
My time cause if it's not you, oh no thank you. I like us
Just fine. You're a rock in a sand, you're a smile in a
Cry, you're my joy through the pain, you're the truth
Through the lies. No matter what i do, i know that i can
Count on you
In December, every sign has its own mode
I was in love with a Sagittarius
See the emotions he put me through
From Capricorns to Aquarius
They all got their different minds
The affection of a Virgo
Which sign matches good with mine?
I was in love with a Sagittarius, he blew my mind
He also had a flip side too much like a Gemini
He was freaky like a Taurus, the way he handled me, yeah
Flirtatious like an Aries
Which sign is best for me?
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius
I love all y'all
Hey, I wish he was a Virgo, the same sign as me
And know how to show me love, 'cause I've been hurt by a Pisces
(Rewind)
I wish he was a Virgo, the same sign as me
I want him sexy like a Scorpio
The way he holds me close, yeah
Sensitive as a Cancer
Every sign from coast to coast
I can't explain why I love him
Bossy like Leo's do
Got game like an Aquarius
Switch moves after he's been with you
Fun like a Libra
He stays on my mind
He's so unpredictable
He reminds me of every sign
Every sign from the first to the last (Ohh)
Everyday of the month has its good and its bad
(Everyday of the month)
I love you all, all twelve signs
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, 
oh
Every one of these signs, you know you blowing me away
No matter when you're born for sure with me you okay
I love every one of y'all no matter what sign you are
January to December, here's my open arms
Daddy used to take me walkin' down the street
Daddy used to take my hand, say, "Follow me"
Daddy used to lead me back home all the time
I got big enough to run around, Daddy left me outside
He said, "Find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Come back home 'fore the street lights on
Find your way back"
Daddy used to tell me, "Look up at the stars
It's been a long time, but remember who you are
Circle of life, and one day, I might not make it
Circle of life, and one day, I might not make it"
"But you just gotta find your way back
Daddy used to teach me all my moves
Runnin' 'round wild, had to tie my shoes
Itty bitty child with a smile like you
Wild, wild child, look a lot like you
Daddy used to teach me all my tricks
Runnin' 'round wild, had to get my fix
Daddy used to teach me all my plays
On a marathon, have to run my race
"Find your way back
Find your way back, yeah"

Love you like crazy, now say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go (Say)
Say you'll never let me go (Hey)
Say you'll never let me go
Take you away from here
There's nothing between us but space and time
I'll be your own little star
Let me shine in your world
In your own little universe, make me your girl
Baby, come on get up on it
Show me that you really want it
I wanna be the one to love you, baby, let's go (Whoa)
Let's go (Whoa)
I wanna provide this loving that you're giving
I ain't frontin' in this love, but
Can you let me love you from your head to toe? (Whoa)
Baby, let's go (Whoa)
Boy, come to me (Come to me)
Let me turn your rain into sun (Come to me, baby)
You don't have to worry, baby (Oh, no)
I promise I'll set your heart free
Let my love into your soul
You go, I go, we go, that's all she wrote
Say you'll, say say, say you'll, nev, never
(Can't you see, babe?)
(I just wanna love you)
(Can't you feel me, babe?)
I just wanna be with you
I just wanna live for you
I'll never let you go
Free your love to me
I will be the one to kiss you at night (You at night)
This is for them 20-somethings
Time really moves fast, you were just sixteen
This is for them 30-somethings
That didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be
This is for them 40-somethings
Well, raise up your glass and laugh like a motherfucker
This is for them 50-somethings
Hell, you're halfway there, baby, take it to the head
Mom and dad, tried hide the world
Said the world is just too big for a little girl
Eyes wide open, can't you see?
I had my first heels by the age of 13
Mom and dad, tried hide the boys
I swear, that just made 'em want me more
At 14, they asked what I wanna be
I said, "Baby, 21, so I can get me a drink"
I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you something
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I’m great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, tap, sway, boy out of sight
And I’m crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh (Schoolin’ life)
This is for them pretty somethings
Living in a fastlane, see you when you crash, babe
This is for them sexy somethings
That body ain't gon' always get you out of everything
This is for them bitter somethings
Stop living in regret, baby, it's not over yet
And this is for them trippin' somethings
That's high on life, baby, put me on your flight
You know it costs to be the boss
One day you'll run the town
For now, make your life what you decide
Baby, party till the fire marshall's shut this sucker down
(Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?) Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
There's not a real way to live this... for real
Just remember stay relentless
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't stop running until it's finished
It's up to you, the rest is unwritten
Hey, hey, hey
I don't wanna wake, wake
Excuse me? Um, I love you
Who starts a conversation like that? Nobody but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up or hide you
I'll get you out my mind, hmm, I try to
Why you? In my dreams, I knew
You knew how to be there, you knew how to treat it
You knew how to keep it, I wanna do more than touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you up to
We can leave right now, nigga, you don't need a duffle
La Perla, provocateur of secrets
How is it a secret if I know you're gonna peep it?
I see you peeking, don't wanna hear a peep
Wait
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh
You're such a dream
If you can believe?
Boy you're such a dream to me, yeah, yeah
Hey there, boy, I love you
I'm feeling like I know you, I can't help but wanna thug you
I'm watching all these broads trying so damn hard
But I can't even blame 'em 'cause you're so irresistible
I want to stand and yell, I won't ever dare to tell
I think I heard some wedding bells (keep that to yourself)
Is this real?
Ooh child, I can stop praying now
Past life, let's rewind
To the day when I met you
Throwback
Dear God, how could I forget you?
Your sex
Boy, it feels just like a dream to me
Now
(You're such dream)
So to whom
It may concern
Please don't disturb me
Can't you see?
I'm happy, happily sleep, yeah
I don't wanna wake up, oh
*Baby Noises*
Ma ma, ma ma
(Don't mess with my baby
They better not mess with my baby)
Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about Father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife
You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"
Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off
Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that's just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer, so sexy)
After all your tears
After all that pain's all clear
Mama, after all them years
We can start all over again
Mama, and now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end
Mama, we can love again
This is where freedom begins
Mama, so put your love on top
You gon' shine and put your love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Everybody put your love on top
Aye, love on top
Girl you so fine, put your love on top
If you're going through it, just know it's called "going THROUGH it"
You're not gonna get stuck there, you're not gonna die
You're gonna survive
I love to love you, baby
I'm feeling sexy
I wanna hear you say my name, boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame
I'm feelin' kind of n-a-s-t-y
I might just take you home with me
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
Your vibe has just taken over me
Start feeling so crazy, babe
Lately, I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feeling so crazy, babe
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
You're so sexy
Tonight, I am all yours, boy
The way your body moves across the floor
I love to love you, baby (I love to love you, baby)
You’re bad for me
I clearly get it
I don’t see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
'Cause with every hug and kiss, you’re snatching every bit of strength
That I’m gon' need to fight off the inevitable
And it’s a heart breakin' situation I’m up in, but I can’t control
You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do, it’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you, I don’t want it, but I do
My affliction, I’m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
You ain't right take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait, wait, wait, I’m alive
But how long will it last?
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What’s the prognosis will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down
Baby
It’s just not my body (No)
It’s my mind, you don’t know
How many times I told myself
This can't do (Can't do)
And that I don’t need you (No, I don’t need you, no)
It’s so unfair that I find myself right back in your care
And what’s good is that when you’re not always there
(There, there)
You're no good for my health (My health)
You’re just like poison (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Baby, kiss me one more time
9-4-'81
B'Day
Mission one; I'ma put this on
When he see me in the dress, I'ma get me some (Hey)
Mission two; gotta make that call
Tell him get the bottles poppin' when they play my song (Hey)
Mission three; got my three best friends
Like we do it all the time, we gon' do it again (Hey)
Mission four; got the vintage Rolls
Drop a couple hundreds tell him "Leave it at the door"
I ain't worried, doin' me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight gettin' bodied
Gettin' bodied, gettin' bodied
Want my body
Won't you get me bodied
You want my body
Won't you get me bodied (Hey)
Can you get me bodied?
I wanna be myself tonight
Don't you see my body?
I wanna let it out tonight
Wanna party, wanna dance
Wanna be myself tonight, get me bodied
Mission five; skip to the front of the line
Let me fix my hair up 'fore I go inside (Hey)
Mission six; gotta check these chicks
'Cause you know they gon' block when I take these flicks (Hey)
Mission seven; gotta make my rounds
Givin' eyes to the guys now I think I found him (Hey)
Mission eight; now we conversate
And we can skip small talk, let's get right to the chase (Hey)
You should see my body
I gotta know enough to know if you can get me bodied
I'm kinda tight, I'm feelin' right, enough to see somebody
I wanna let it off tonight
Wanna dance, wanna party
Wanna be myself tonight
Won't you sing my body
Wanna be myself tonight, me bodied
Baby, all I want is to let it go
Ain't no worries, oh
We can dance all night
Get me bodied
That means come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
And your body's touching my body
All I need is to let it be
Ain't no worry, no
Boy, dance with me
Feel my body
Don't stop, just come closer to me
With your body touching my body
All I'm thinking 'bout is getting bodied
Ain't no shame 'cause I gotta get mine
I swing my hair and kick off my shoes
Come here, boy, let me work on you
If I begged and if I cried
Would it change the sky tonight?
Would it give me some light?
Should I wait for you to call?
Is there any hope at all?
Are you drifting by?
When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
And when I lie all by myself
I see your face, I hear your voice
My heart stays faithful
And time has come and time has passed
If it's good, it's got to last
It feels so right
You, you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
I missed all the signs, one at a time
You were ready
What did I know?
Starting our lives
Now my love, I'm ready to show
And then you disappear
You disappear, you disappear
You disappear, disappear
I guess love just wasn't enough for us to survive
I swear, I swear, I swear I tried
You took the life right out of me
I'm so unlucky I can't breathe
You took the life right out of me, me, me, me
I'm longing for your heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat
I'm a trainwreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle, yes, indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention, I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes, I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And that's exactly what I mean
And that's why I love you, you, you...
To be or not to be... not!
Hold up, bring the beat back
Stop! I ain’t ready yet
Wait! Let me fix my hair, yes, yes
Yes ma'am, yes ma'am
Now pass me my dress, yes
I think I’m ready
Been locked up in the house way too long
It’s time to get it
'Cause once again he’s out doing wrong
And my girls are so real
Said it’s been a minute since I had some
He’s been acting up
But he won’t be the only one
'Cause when he acts up, that’s when you put it on
Get him uptight, this is your song
Hold out your back, time to impress
Pull out your freakum dress
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, every woman got one
Oh, shut it down when the time comes
Oh, pull out the big guns
Oh, and put your freakum dress on
Soon as he saw me
Turned on by how the dress was fittin' right
Short and backless (Backless, backless)
See my silhouette in the moonlight
Such an attraction
Keep tellin' me how my outfit’s so nice
Little did he know
Ha, my man gon' take it off tonight
All the ladies, you ain't get all dressed up
In your dresses and your best digs with no reason
Get ready to freakum, freakum
When you put it on, it’s an invitation
When they play your song, get on up and shake it
Work it out your back, you don’t have to waste it
Spin it all around then take it to the ground and
Spin it all around then take it to the ground
Oh, every woman got one (every woman got one)
Oh, shut it down when the time comes (When the time comes)
Ladies, look it here
When you been with your man for a long time, oh
Every now and then you gotta go in the back of that closet
And pull out that freakum dress, oh
I got my freakum dress on
I got my freakum dress on, oh
Now, now, now, honey
You better sit down and look around
'Cause you must've bumped yo' head
And I love you enough to talk some sense back into you, baby
I'd hate to see you come home, me the kids
And the dog is gone
Check my credentials
I give you everything you want everything you need
Even your friends say I'm a good woman
All I need to know is why?
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me?
When I make me so damn easy to love
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me?
When I make me so damn easy to need?
I got beauty, I got class
I got style, and I got ass
And you don't even care to care
Look here
I even put money in the bank account
Don't have to ask no one to help me out
You don't even notice that
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
I got beauty, I got heart
Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp
But you don't care to know I'm smart
Now, now now now now now now
I got moves in your bedroom
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do
But you don't seem to be in tune
When I make me so damn easy to need
There's nothing not to love about me
No, no, there's nothing not to love about me
I'm lovely
There's nothing not to need about me
No, no, there's nothing not to need about me
Maybe you're just not the one
Or maybe you're just plain
Dumb
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I find myself in love racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong
I wanna run (Run)
Smash into you
And smash into you
Ears closed
What I hear, no one else has to know
'Cause I know
That what we have is worth first place in gold
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong, oh
I wanna run (run)
Oh...
I'm in love and I'm racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love (Your love)
Ohh, I wanna run
I'm willing to run (Run)
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Damn, that was so good
I wanna buy him a short set
I’ma be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store
I’ma be like a waffle cone that’s dripping down to the floor
The way you do it for me, I can’t lie (Lie!)
About to be up in the mall all night (Yes!)
Whatever I get you putting it on (Yes!)
Don’t give me no lip, let mama do it all
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
Your suga, give mama some suga mama
Suga ma-ma, ma-ma
I’m your suga mama (Suga mama)
I don’t want no baby on my waist
'Cause I’m a suga ma-ma-ma-ma
I’m your suga mama (Suga mama, hey, hey)
Sit on mama lap, hey!
Come sit on mama lap, hey!
Come sit on mama lap, hey, hey!
It’s so good to the point that I’d
Do anything to keep you home (On the phone)
Baby, what you want me to buy?
My accountant’s waiting on the phone (On the phone)
Just the thought of making love to you (You!)
Dropping everything that’s what I’ll do (I'll do!)
Whatever I get, you putting it on (Oh!)
Now, take it off while I watch you perform
And I’ve always been the type to take care of mine
I know just what I’m doing
Don’t you worry it’s cool and everything is steady
Got you you on my taxes already, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I promise I won’t let no bills get behind
'Cause every touch, every kiss and hug
You best believe it’ll be on time
Suga mama, mama, mama, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your suga, give mama some suga mama (I give you all my money, baby)
Suga ma-ma, ma-ma (Turn me out, boy, something crazy)
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be (Take my credit cards, take my house, take my car)
I don’t want no baby on my waist (Don't forget to give mama some sugar)
'Cause I’m a suga ma-ma-ma-ma (Some sugar, when you walk out that door)
Sit on mama lap, hey, hey! (yes)
Come sit on mama lap, hey! (yes)
Come sit on mama lap, hey, hey! (yeah)
Come sit on mama lap, hey, hey! (yeah, yeah)
Sit on mama lap, hey, hey!
Give it to mama
Give it, give it
Give it to my mama, oh
Give it
Give it to my mama
For some strange reason
You're done pleasin' me like it's okay, ohh
Like a perm that's been left too long (It's starts to burn)
The result is it just won't take, ohh (I can see)
Now it's all coming so clear to me now (I can see)
Misinterpreted all my naiveness
Was just thinking if I had no you then I can't do
My stock just went up over two million
So if you want to, you got the green light
(Give it to mama)
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, red light, green light
Some see me, say I should be trophied
'Cause it gets no stronger
Ladies y'all know (Yeah girl, ya'll know)
This pimp -ish gets no older
Is that a threat? (What's another threat?)
Yep! (That's another threat)
I'm immune, you can get no colder
You got the green light, you the king, right?
You holdin' up traffic, green means go!
Go, go, go, goooo
(I said you're holdin' up traffic, green means go!)
So if you want to, you got the green light (Green light, baby)
(Go, go, go, go)
Ain't no problem, you can go
I will find somebody else (Go, go, go, go)
It's alright, I'll move along
You got the green light so you can go
I gave all I could give
My love, my heart
Now we're facing the end
From what you did from the start, my love
You're holdin' up traffic, green means go!
I will find somebody else
So why not move along?
(go, go, go, go)
Go, go, green light
I feel weak, we've been here before
'Cause I feel we keep going back and forth
Maybe it's over, maybe we're through
But I honestly can say "I still love you"
Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find
Let's start over, let's give love their wings
Let's start over, stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over, we can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over, give love another life
I can see that we're not happy here
So why would we keep pretending when there's nothing there?
Maybe you like it, well, I don't
Maybe you'll settle, well, I won't
I know that this will hurt you, I know you'll cry
I know I called you selfish, but that's a lie
I feel I know what's the best for us
Let's... start over!
And let's give love their wings
Let's start over, I'm tired of fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over, we both know that this love won't die
Maybe we can start all over, and give love another life

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
I said yes, we can be together
Yes, you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight
You actin' so ungratefully
You was on the wall
I was with my crew
You was watchin' me, baby
I was watchin' you
Slowly you walked over
I maintained my cool
You said hello to me
I said hello to you
You ask me where I'm from
I asked you what you do
You somehow intrigued me
I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye, I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night, so I gave my number to you
Certainly you can call me, baby
I love to hear from you
Yes, of course you can come and see me, boy
I want to get to know you more
I'm feelin' you
No, baby, not yet, we can't take that next step
Why you getting so upset?
Boy, you act as though I never told you yes before
You are so ungrateful, mmm, mmmm
You was at my house
I was sittin' on my couch
You was really buggin''
So I told you to get out
I had been misjudging you
You had a lotta nerve
You too damn old to be so immature
I hope you learn
You said I move too slow
I showed you to the door
You said you'd call me later
I said don't call no more
It's cool if you can't wait for me
I'm glad you let me know
'Cause you show me your true face, baby
The first time I said no
It's like I never said yes
That's how you like it, huh
That's how I like it, baby
I need a thug that'll have my back
Do-rag, Nike Airs to match
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
Where my thugs at?
White T-Shirt (I love that)
Timberland boots, you does that, it's a fact
I like the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you dress
The way you smile
I like the way you are
The way you ain't
I like your honesty, integrity
It levels me, so please, don't ever change
I like the way you brush your hair
I like the stylish clothes you wear
It's just the real things you do
That's why I wanna stick with you
Where my girls at?
Let them know we love that
Sexy way they does that (You did that)
I hope you like my style
The way I dress
The way I flirt
Say yes
I hope you like my mind
The things I say
If I'm with you, then I'm with only you
My loyalty will never, ever change
I know you've heard I'm a gangsta
They say "Stay away from them gangstas"
They never change up, or pull they pants up
Well, baby girl, put ya foot down
Don't let 'em push you around, you know what you like
Baby thug, you know wrong from right
You done felt grown before
This can't be what it feel like
And they don't really know whatcha feel like
For instance
They don't know the difference between real life
And the music videos and the raggedy magazines
They have it badder than he seems
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
I ain't mad at you, it's just my glide
Way I wear my hat to the side
Way I lean real low when I ride
That's why my minds, they like my walk
My accent from New York
My way of thinking is slightly off
They like the way he floss
Leave the block on a bike, he come back on a Porsche
But of course
Most of all, they like my honesty, integrity, my loyalty
Young Hova and the letter B
How you like that, huh?
My body is magnified
In the sun, set me alight
My body and your delights
Burn me up, set me alight
I can't deny, your desire
Feel like I'm on fire
When, you touch me
I feel the flame lickin' at my feet
Kiss you while the sun kisses me
Can you feel the heat on my skin?
Can you feel all my lovin'?
You and me
We're standin' on the sun
Can you feel my heart burnin'?
Can you feel all my good lovin'?
Feel everything
Standin' on the sun
Let's get to huggin' and kissin'
Don't know the floor from the ceilin'
We cook it up in the kitchen
Nobody hotter than you
You know that I twerk it
And give you somethin' that's worth it
But d-d-daddy that's perfect
This 'yoncé only for you
All that ocean, can't you see it?
Mix up passion with fruit, sangria
BB Cubana, ay que lindo
Ya tu sabes camino como cocino, primo
There's only one thing on my mind
I wanna love you long time
Want you to watch me while I wind
Want you to love me long time
We're just havin' such a good time
Over and over we find
With the flame lickin' at my feet
Your body turn up, me say "Turn up, turn up"
Gyal you hot like the sun, so you turn up, turn up
Gyal you like the sun, so you turn up, Beyonce
I can't deny your desire
When you touch me
I feel the flame lickin' at my feet, oh
You've got me (You've got me)
You've got me speechless
Where you been, baby?
Waited for you all day
Waited for you to use the key
That opens my place
My heart starts trembling
As I hear your footsteps pace
Lock opened, doorknob turned
There appears your face
Going outta my head, I think I'm losing all my mind
Drive me crazy, burning candles, making love all night
Feels so strange, it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms lost for words
You've got me
Ohh
Laying so closely
I feel your skin rubbing and touching me
Only sweat between us
Feeling you kissing and pleasing me
I rub your back
I kiss your neck
I know that you love when we touch like that
I can feel you need me
Feels so good to me
Yes, yes, yes
Speechless, all I can say is
All I can say is
Yes, yes, yes, yes
Kiss me
Hold me
Speechless
The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got (Tell me more)
Your love has captured me
Over and over again
I tried to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
But all the while, inside, I knew it was real (Ooh)
The way you make me feel
Lyin' here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more, more and more (More and more)
Let's give love a try (Let's give love a try)
Sweeter and sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With hearts of love will find
True love in a special way
Oh, ooh, oh, ooh, the closer I get (The closer I get)
Closer I get to you, baby
The more you make me see (The more you make me see)
More you make me see
By givin' me what you got, ohh yeah
Your love captures me (Your love captures... woo!)
Oh, over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
When all the while inside I knew this was real (Got to be real)
Got to be real
They you make me feel
You know, you know, you know
My baby, my baby, my baby
My love
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah)
(Come closer love)
Come a little closer so that we can see
Into the eyes of love
I want to see into those eyes of love
(Come closer, love)
Just a little closer let me speak to you
I want to softly tell you something
Here I am, here's my love, I just want you to...
Come a little closer let me whisper in your ear
Cuz I wanna tell you something
I wanna whisper in your ear so softly...so come closer, love
 (Come closer, love)
Move on in real close so we can celebrate
The way we feel a bout each other's loving
I wanna tell you words, words of love...
Took me a while, but I'm finally here
So I just wanna testify, make it crystal clear
See I've been picked out to be picked on
Talked about out my friends mouth
I've been beat down
Til he turned my life around
(turn my life around)
Seems like I always fall short, of being worthy
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
I ain't no superstar, the spotlight ain't shinin on me
(no no no no no)
Loves me
I used to wake up somedays, and wish I'd stayed asleep
Cuz I went to bed on top of the world
Today the worlds on top of me
Everybody's got opinions (they share)
They ain't been in my position (they don't care)
That it breaks my heart when I hear what they
Have to say about me yeah (what they say)
Seems like I always fall short (fallin short)
Of bein worthy (Lord I ain't worthy)
Cuz I ain't good enough (no no)
But he still loves me (still loves me)
I ain't no superstar (I ain't no superstar)
The spotlight ain't shinin on me (but I want to be for you)
I'm not perfect (I'm not perfect)
Yes I do wrong (yes I do wrong)
I'm trying my best (trying my best but)
But it ain't good enough (just ain't good enough)
Shunned by the world (shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed, cuz I ain't good
But he still loves me (I just ain't good enough)
If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed
To be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything
Cuz through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do without out blame
Feels like we always fall short, of bein worthy (we are not worthy)
I ain't no superstar (I ain't no superstar but I wanna be for you Lord)
The spotlight ain't shinin on me
Cuz I ain't good enough, but you still love me
I'm not perfect, yes I do wrong
I'm tryin my best but (tryin my best)
It ain't good enough (I'm not good enough)
Shunned be the word (shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed (I don't succeed-ceed-ceed)
(child sing with me)
I'm tryin my best but it ain't good enough
(But the Lord's been so good to me)
Shunned be the word (Shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed
Cuz I ain't good enough (I ain't good enough)
But he still loves me (The Lord still loves me)
No I ain't good enough, but He still loves me
(Raise your hands if ya understand)
No I ain't good enough (How he blessed you cuz he blessed you too)
But He still loves me (even though I ain't worthy)
No I ain't good enough (you ain't worthy, He's there for you)
But He still loves me (no matter what I do)
No I ain't good enough (I ain't good enough)
But he still loves me (but the Lord still loves me)
Boy, you'll be the death of me
You're my James Dean
You make me feel like I'm seventeen
You drive too fast
You smoke too much
But that don't mean a thing, 'cause I'm addicted to the rush
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
You know I've been in love before
You're the first one I've ever seen that burns like gasoline
So light a match, turn off the lights
I'm holding on to you cause this might be our last night
What I'm telling you
I'm giving you my life, it's in your hands
And what I'm gonna do
Is be a woman and you can be a man
And I wanna say
Nobody understands what we've been through
I'd rather give up everything
Than to live my, live my life without you
Tell me, who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off?
’Cause I been on, I been on, I been on
Rollin' high, leather and wood
Keep it trill, that’s what's good
Kiss my mama, show that love
I heard your boo was talkin' lip
Guess what they did, smacked that trick
The capital B means I'm 'bout that life
The capital B means I’m ’bout that life
’Cause I been on
I was in that Willie D video when I was about fourteen, lookin' crazy
Shout out to Pimp C
You know, we used to sneak and listen to that UGK
Didn't **** your girl but your sister was alright, man
Ah-ah in ya homeboy’s Caddy last night, man, hahahahaha
Hol' up, Texas trill
H-Town goin' down, man
I'm in this fight and I'm swinging, and my arms are getting tired
I'm trying to beat this emptiness, but I'm running out of time
I'm sinking in the sand and I can barely stand
And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I try to be patient, but I'm hurting deep inside
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home?
'Cause I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you would stretch your hand looking for mine
I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness, I think I'm drowning
I can't be lonely no more
Ohh, baby
I love the way you make me feel
It slows down time
Come in my bedroom and turn off the lights
You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind
The way you touch me lets me know you're mine
I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name
And there's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because you hustle hard to take care of me
Boy, I'd rather be with you (Boy, I'd rather be with you)
I love the way you look at me
Stare into my eyes
What do they say to you?
Boy, don't be shy
Tonight's the night your fantasies will all come true
I am your woman
I belong to you, whoa
There is nothing I won't do for you
I know my soul connected me to you
I feel so safe when I'm alone with you
I'm holding back nothing
Saving it all for you
Baby, I love making love to you
It's like a high I can't come down from you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name (Scream my name)
And makes me feel this way (Feel this way)
I'd rather be with you, oh, yeah
Boy, I'd rather be with you
And makes me feel this way (Make me feel good)
So what are you gonna say at my funeral, now that you've killed me? Here lies the body of the love of my life, whose heart I broke without a gun to my head. Here lies the mother of my children, 
both living and dead
. Rest in peace, my true love, who I took for granted. Most bomb p*ssy who, because of me, sleep evaded. Her shroud is loneliness. Her god was listening. Her heaven will be a love without betrayal. Ashes to ashes, dust to side chicks.

(Yes, dreamgirls can only belong to you)
I'm not the dream that you've had before
I'm the dream that'll give you more and more
Of life on fertile ground, ancestors put me on game
Ankh charm on gold chains, with my Oshun energy, oh
Drip all on me, woo, Ankh or the Dashiki print
Judgin', runnin' through the house to my art, all black
Put your fists up in the air, show black love (Show black love)
(Woo, woo)
I remember when you use to take me on a bike ride everyday on the bayou
(You remember that? We were inseparable)
And I remember when you could do no wrong
You'd come home from work
 and I jumped in your arms when I saw you
I was so happy to see you (I was so excited, so happy to see you)
Because you loved me, I overcome, yeah
And I'm so proud of what you've become
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I know you're there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you protected me
Treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why…
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me
Daddy, daddy, daddy...
I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend
(My first boyfriend, you should've seen your face)
I still remember I caught you crying cause of my tattoo
Could have said "Beyoncé, I told you so"
Instead you said you'd get one too
(Even my mama said y'all get one just like mine)
Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do
You understand my fears and you protected me
Treasure every extraordinary memory and that's why…
Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in, I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional it won't go away
I know I'm lucky
Know it ain't easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming
Lord, why did you pick me?
Can't stop my tears from falling
I love you so much daddy
(Thank you, you've done so much for me. I love you daddy.)
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
No one else replace my daddy...
I'm the matriarch of your land
When you need to take my hand
Come into my arms, I'll keep you safe from harm
I'll keep your precious heart
Some people try to drag you down
Take it from me, stand and be proud
You're a warrior
You're my warrior
Be who you are
Know that life holds more than what you see
Rise up little man rise up little man
Fight for you and me
Look into my eyes and believe
Little woman we will fight, we will fight
Little woman we will fight, we will rise
I see you and me
Take my hand and we
We will stand we will fight, we will fight
We will stand and together we will rise
They'll burn you at the stake if you
Don't act like they want you to
But baby be yourself
Do good and help the world
Rise up, rise up little man
Don't be scared I'm holding your hand
Know that life holds more than
What we see and what we get
Rise up, rise up little woman
Don't be afraid to risk it all
What we see and what we get, I will
Diamonds used to be coal
Look young 'cause they got soul
That's why they're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
'Til your hands laid on my soul
Baby, that's why you're beautiful
I'm not wondering why
The sky's blue; that's not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love. That could be us."
Lovers used to make love
And died just to give us
Their piece of the beautiful
Remember when we made love?
Love
Wasn't it beautiful?
Don't ask me why
Diamonds used to be coal (Be coal)
Look young 'cause they got soul (got soul)
And my heart used to be cold (be cold)
Somebody's got to stay deep in love
That could be you
That's why we're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
Why, why?
I heard
Church bells ringing
A choir singing
I saw my love
Walk down
The aisle
On her finger
He placed a ring
Oooh, oh
I saw them
Holding hands
She was
Standing there
Wwith my man
Them promise
Til death do
Us part
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart
All I could do
Was cry
I was
Losing the man
That I love
And all
I could do
And now
The wedding
Is over
The rice, rice
Has been
Thrown over
Their heads
For them life
Has just begun
But mine
Is ending
I was losing
The man

Don't you worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight
I was out shopping thinking of something I should get you
Cause I've been gone so many weeks, damn, I miss you
Don't wanna do nothing more than just stare at your face
And let you know I'm happy you're my best friend
Part of this fortune, boy, I owe you
For being always there to talk to
Take some time out, starting with today
For my babe
We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
And I'ma DJ all of your songs
You ain't got to worry 'bout a club
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight tonight, tonight
Let's pop a bottle of the vintage that I bought you!
I'll model sexy pictures right on top of you
Ten years together, still feels like we're making love for the first time
Like I'm in high-school sneaking with my boyfriend
All of this fortune, boy, I owe you
For being always here to talk to
Taking time out, starting with today
Boy, if you just call, I'm on my way
When it comes to my baby, I bring my best
I just wanna party tonight
'Cause it's obvious to see that you're all I wanna be
Uh, just let me look at you!
Uh, you look so sexy boy, I wanna taste!
All unwrapped and on it's way
When I groove with you
Oh, you'll feel so good boy you're my favorite place
Just come and lay up under me!
When you were born, the angels sighed in delight
They never thought they'd see such a beautiful sight
You took the breath and the world was right again
Tears were shed, how we had been blessed
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right, oh
You got a light inside, light inside
God made you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
God made you beautiful, beautiful, you're beautiful
Well look at me, you were brought into my life
I kiss those little feet and watch for your perfect smile
And when it comes, the world stops in your eyes
I found love, I found peace of the purest kind
Thank God, I get on my knees and pray
Thank God for giving me a life
You're beautiful, you're beautiful, too beautiful
God made you beautiful
I be on the hotline, like e'rryday
Makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play
You know I got my top back and my beat low
Rockin' my stunna shades 
and turnin' up my radio
Turn up my radio, radio, radio....
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You're the only one that Papa allowed to hang out in my room
With the door closed, we'd be alone
And mama never freaked out when she heard it go 'BOOM!'
'Cause she knew we were in the zone
Hold him in my arms and look out of my window
(Under the moonlight)
And he be keepin' me calm so I'd never let him go
He's got a place in my heart
When I get into my car, turn it uh-up, uh-up
Then I hear vibrations all up in my truh-unk, uh-unk
And the bassline be rattlin' through my see-eat, ee-eats
Then that crazy feeling starts happeni-ing- i-ing, OH!
I get butterflies when I hear the DJ (Playing the stuff I like)
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays
You know I got my top back and my beat low-oh
and turnin' up my radio-oh
Oh, ooh, whoa, whoa
Oh, ooh, whoa, whoa, ooh
At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh yeah yeah
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known
Oh yeah, when you smile
You smile, Ooh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
There's three things I like about the summertime
Drop tops, long hot nights and summer love
Hey yo, B
Tell 'em what time it is
Let' s go
Out of all the guys that approached me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiousity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I
I wanted more than just a man (man)
I needed a friend (I want a friend)
Someone I can talk to (oh)
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)
When you touched my hand (yeah yeah)
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)
Trusting you I closed my eyes
And felt our love begin
It was the summertime (when we fell in love)
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime (ohh)
Now it's been a year and we're closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside
For me and now you are my prize
Wanna grow old with ya
Fill a house with ya pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together we'll raise a family
I wanted more then just a man
I needed a friend
You are my best friend (yeah)
Someone I could talk to
When you touched my hand (yeah)
Yo let me holla at you for a sec
So what's in gonna be, him or me? (yeah)
We can cruise the world for pearls
And bare boots for girls
Summertime in the linen, fresh fruit
Livin the life that's forbidden for just you (let's go)
No worries you ain't gotta be stressed out
No hurries you ain't gotta be rushed out
Sit back relax ma take your time
Now have a taste of the finest wine
Every minute that we have's a blessing to me
And in your heart you's a "
Child of Destiny
" (that's right)
Them hot summers that we had especially
Love who you is girl, you bring out the best of me
And it's like that, you know it's like that (that's right)
And that's your plan, where's your hand let me ice that
You my heart ain't no chance you could fight that
The summertime, when you hot baby take that, take that
Yeah..
I'm so in love
I'm still in love
I never met love quite before
Until I saw your face
And watching stars without you
My soul cries
My heaving heart
Is full of pain
When we're apart
The aching
I'm kissing you
I'm kissing you, oh
You're my father, you're my soldier
You protect me
Boy you saved me
You're best friend
You're my husband
You are my doctor, counselor, provider, professor, my everything
And I love you, I love you, I love you, yes, I love you
I, I need you, I need you, I need you
I can't live without you
I trust you, I trust you with every ounce of me
Just teach me boy teach me just take me
When we make love I can feel all your spirits
Deep inside of me yea
Baby you're so pure, oh
I'm kissing you forever and ever and ever
I love kissing you, kissing you, kissing you
I love everything about you, baby
It's been so many years since we found love
You got something special, baby
We can cry together
We can grow together
Be ourselves together
And I love you
More than music
Yes, I love you more than music
I rather be kissing you, oh
Kissing you
Haaaa
(Come on baby)
(One night)
(One night only)
You want all my love and my devotion
You want my loving soul right on the line
I had no doubt that I could love you forever
The only trouble is I really don't have the time
I've got one night only
One night only
That's all I have to spare
Let's not pretend you care
Come on, we better come on
We only have 'til dawn
(We only have 'til dawn)
(We only have 'til dawn!)
One night only (Oh)
One night only (Yeah-yeah)
One night only (Come on, come on)
You and I will be running out of time!
Whoo yeah (Come on, come on)
Whoo, come on (Come on, come on)
Come on (Come on, come on)
Come on, yeah (Come on, come on)
Come on, come on
Come on!
Satellites flashing by
It's a beautiful state we're in
But how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try
We're nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You don't know how I bleed
When I leave your side
In your eyes, love's alive
You've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites
Take all the rules away
How can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display
Let's run and hide
In our eyes, love's alive
We've come untied
If we don't communicate
We'll exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While we're apart, I cannot breathe
How you doing honey baby?
You know I don't ask for much, but
For a girl spending time alone can be pretty rough
But I get a knock on my door
You know it's yours for sure
We can't wait for the bedroom
So we just hit the floor
Is y'all alright?
I don't know but I know what's happening to me, girl
Uh, break it down now
See you gotta work it out
A brotha gotta work it out
Chad, blow your horn now
Come on Chad, blow your horn now
So we shaking back and forth now
Just keep it coming babe
Treat my body like a guitar
You got to - you got to keep on strumming
But in the back of my mind
I wonder is it gonna be the last time?
Well if there ain't nobody loving and you gon' keep it coming
Well baby with me that's fine
I like this
Look it here, ha
Bridge!
So baby hold me like you don't wanna let go
I'm feeling foxy cause boy you working it out
Daddy you've given me a taste of your honey
I want the whole beehive
I'm gonna call you my sugar
Cause I had the sweetest time
I like it when the horn go 
Ha, Austin better work it out
Ha, Foxxy better work it out
Ha, AP3 better work it out
Do you think
You could fall for a woman like me
'Cause I find it hard to trust
I need too much
And I really don't believe in love, no no
That I could be the girl of your dreams
Sometimes I don't let things go
Get emotional
And sometimes I'm just out of control
You need to stop for a minute
Before you get too, deep up in it
(Too deep)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
(Woman like me)
You need to think about it
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(No no)
Can't believe everything you see
That I could be the one that you seek
'Cause baby I'm one step ahead
You're two steps behind
But baby I don't mind
That I can make you real happy baby
Just don't get me wrong
My loving is so strong
But I ain't tryna lead you on
(Seems)
(Without it)
Woman like me
(Stop for a minute)
(Before you get too deep up in it)
(Think about it, baby)
(No, no)
{Outro: Beyoncé}
A gift from virgo
I wish I could look in your eyes
And tell you how I feel right now inside
Baby, I know that it's real
So real, so real, so real
How I wish I could be with you
How I wish, how I wish, how I wish I could be with you right now
Every morning, every afternoon, every night
I wanna be with you
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play
Stay in the hotel room all day
I love everything about you from your old school tennis shoes
To the way you move when you're dancing with me
Do you remember our first kiss?
It wasn't long enough
Remember the first time we spent those weeks together?
They were not long enough
All of our conversations
All of your sweet pages
They're never long enough
When it's time for me to leave
It's so hard to say goodbye
I never want to say goodbye
I never, ever want to say goodbye
One day we'll make love
Finally I'll be yours
Only you, only you, I could love you
But it's too late, I already love you
I love you, I love you
Baby, I see you, that look in your eyes
Hips that keep shaking, mysterious style
Exotically tempting, familiar to me
That Creole sexy, it's all over me
So all my red bones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and you call it Creole
(Creole!) When I look real good
(Creole!) Whenever I talk real good
(Creole!) Whenever I bounce real good
Just in case you wanna know, that's your secret
(Creole!) When she look that good
(Creole!) Whenever she talk that good
(Creole!) Whenever she bounce that good
Ladies, if you wanna know, this your secret
Creole!
Bad, bad, bad, bad yellow bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad red bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad brown bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad to the bone
For all of my brown bones
That make a good broth
And all of my red bones that make a good sauce
The yellow bone flavor is familiar to me
Mix it all together; it's a delicacy
When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable rights" of "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." We refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. So we have come to cash this check — a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice
Lord forgive me, I've been running
I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
Sing it, y'all
Cause I need freedom too!
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves
Lord forgive me, I've been runnin'
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
Meet me at the finish line
40 acres, gimme mine
Revolution televised
Hopin' that you see the signs
Lemonade all the time, keep that in mind
Formation, formation
Exclamation, formation
Fellow great Americans, hello
This is heritage for my medicine
Six headlights aimin' in my direction
Fire marshalls and hazardous
Obviously guidin' me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah, open correctional gates in higher desert
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
I lay alone awake at night
Sorrow fills my eyes
But I'm not strong enough to cry
Despite of my disguise
I'm left with no shoulder
But everybody wants to lean on me
I guess I'm their soldier
Well, who's gonna be mine?
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help?
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world
After she saves the world?
I bottle all my hurt inside
I guess I'm living a lie
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life?
A simple word, a gesture
Someone to say you're beautiful
Come find this buried treasure
Rainbows lead to a pot of gold
After she saves the world (After she saves the world)
After she saves the world? (After she saves the world)
(After she saves the world)
I've given too much of myself and now it's driving me crazy
(I'm crying out for help)
Sometimes I wish someone would just come here and save me
Save me from myself
Never knew how much I love you
Never knew how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I wanna treat you right
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you outta know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said to Julie "Baby you're my flame"
He givest fever
When we kisseth
Fever with my flaming youth
Fever, I'm on fire
Fever, yeah I burn forsooth
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said "Daddy, oh don't you dare"
He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
Daddy won't you treat him right
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade
They give ya fever
When we kiss ya
Fever if you live and learn
Fever until you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
Catch the fever
It ain't for everybody!
(Uhh) Welcome to Hollywood, baby
(Take a picture) Uh-huh
You coming with? (Let's not even talk about it)
Let's do it (Let's Go!)
I see your jealousy as you watching
You watchin'
It's kinda sexy to me how you watching (You watching)
I see your face (I see your face)
You wanna touch it (You wanna touch it)
Come to my place (Come to my place)
And let's discuss this (Let's chop it up)
Tonight you'll be
A superstar
Come let me sign you up
(Let's get into it)
Ooh, it's the lights (You're blinded by the)
Action! (You need that)
Hollywood
Satisfaction! (You need that)
You got's to get it (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Do you want it? (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
But you don't need it (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Until you do (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Hey
Tonight you'll be (Uh)
Come let me sign you up (up, up, up)
Hollywood (Come on, come on, come on)
You hear it screamin' (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
The camera's rollin (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You're so addictive (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Like Hollywood (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing like Hollywood (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And everybody's warning you about it (Oh!)
And once you taste it, you can't live without it (No, no, no, no)
Not cause you choose to not live without it (Oh!)
It's now a part of you (It's now a part of you)
And everybody's warning you about it (Hey!)
And once you taste it, you can't live
Ooh it's the lights (It's the lights) (You're blinded by the)
Action! (Action!) (You need that)
Hollywood (Hollywood)
Ooh it's the lights (Satisfaction) (You're blinded by the)
Satisfaction! (So addictive) (You need that)
Hollywood (Hey, Hollywood)
Now you wanna be seen
Male groupies
Now you've become what you once despised
James Dean, John Belushi
Blow your whole life Tryna live in the lights
Heroins followin', Marilyn Hoppin'
Over the edges Like Janice Joplin
River Phoenix, Jimi Hendrix
Jimmy Morrison
All of them ended by
I see your face and a you wanna touch
Come to my place and we can discuss it
Welcome to Hollywood
Sweetness flowing like a faucet, body bangin' no corset
Brother's wanna toss it but they lost cause my game made em forfeit
Slicker than a porpoise and thicker than a horse's
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless
I stick to my thesis, 
eyes stick to my features
Brother's try to hold but they game never reaches
And most of these cats are like the middle of peaches
I see you lookin' at but what you lookin' at
We in a bar , wanna twist me like a bottle cap
I'm tryin' to holler miss to see if you gon' holler back
Your game is whack, and no, you will not get your quarter back
See this is Carmen, curves like a cul-de-sac
Skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you ain't dunking that
But this is Milla, Lieutenant if you're wonderin'
And I'm Natheniel, (Mos Def) Mel Gibson (Sam) Danny Gloverin'
But I'm not hearing you, you might as well be mumb-l-in
See, I have dreams  and with a man, what will become of them?
There's not a kid out here who can make me believe
I should postpone my goals, cause he got tricks up his sleeve?
Whole bar full of cuffs and you ain't locking me down
I got a warrant for ya heart, in the bed, hold the trial
Get a pardon if ya come with the sargeant now
Give  the chair cause I don't care I ain't feelin' your style
Yo, I'm tryin' to get with you shorty
(But I'm not feelin' you)
But I'm an officer shorty
(My looks are killin' you)
Murder one will get you under the covers
(Game talker or manslaughter I ain't feelin' you brothers)
Eyes like the ocean
Ma I got some lotion
Hold ya thighs, raise em' high and daddy long stroke em'
Hair like forever
I swear I could do it better
Take the gun out my holster, I still pack a baretta
You brothers sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing
But that kid
Don't waste ya time he ain't worth doin'
He just a sargeant, passin' out tickets for parking
Chickenheads cluckin'
Pitiful bulls barkin'
See this is Carmen, voice sweet as Marvin
I turn out lights with the switch when I'm walkin'
Girls steady jealous cause they man always hawkin'
Even got Lou lookin' at me like he stalkin'
And I got a mind too, I wouldn't bless you
If your first name was Ha-Chu, on Sunday singin' gospel
You ain't a dime just a nickel actin' hostile
Headed for the big top and bouncin' off this side show
I sometimes wish I could just be anonymous and walk down the street just like everyone else
Before I was famous I was the girl on the heel with the guitar
I was the girl who just wanted a beautiful view of the beach
And now that I'm famous, it's really really difficult to do very simple things
I think it's the hardest thing to give up
But my mother always taught me to be strong and to never be a victim, never make excuses, never expect anyone else to provide for me things I know I can provide for myself
I have dreams, and I feel like I have a power to actually make those dreams a reality
When you're famous no one looks at you as a human anymore, you become the property of the public
There's nothing real about it
Just look at these dazzling women
The finest representatives of our nation
Ready to reach for the stars and grab the crown
You can't put your finger on who I am
I can't put my finger on who I am
I am complicated
I grew up with a lot of conflict, and drama's, and I've been through a lot just like everyone else
My escape was always music and I'm so lucky that that's my job
But if I accomplished all of these things and had no one to share with, it would be worth nothing
You know, you need something real in order for any of this stuff to matter
You have to have something that is forever
Something that's invisible
I was brought up seeing my mother try to please and make everyone comfortable
And I always felt like it was my job to fix the problem
People pleaser, but I'm no longer afraid of conflict and I don't think conflict is a bad thing
Because I know that when you grow up, when you learn a few things , you're no longer afraid of letting go, you're no longer afraid of the unknown
You're no longer afraid of going to certain places in your body and your mind and your soul that may make you feel uncomfortable
And it all starts with if you could look at yourself in the mirror and say "I like that person," you know?
If I hadn't gone through, you know, some of the painful experiences in my life, I would not be me
And I feel like my body is borrowed and this life is very temporary
I watched my friends body deteriorate and to see some one pass on so gracefully put everything into perspective
We do not value ourselves enough
Especially young people don't really appreciate how brilliant our bodies are
I've always been very very specific and very choosy, very choosy about what I do with my body and who I want to share that with
People feel like they lose something when they get married but it doesn't have to be that way
There's nothing more exciting than having a witness to your life
I always considered myself a feminist, although I was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it
When, honestly, it's very simple
It's just when, you know, a person that believes in equality for men and women
Men and women balance each other out, and we have to get to a point where we are comfortable with appreciating each other
I have a lot of empathy for men, and the pressures that they go through and the cultures that have been created, especially for African-American men
I have the same empathy for women, and the pressures we go through
The woman has to provide so many things for their children
I consider myself a humanist
You know, everybody's not good at everything
You know, it's OK to depend on someone
It's actually what we're supposed to do
We're supposed to depend on each other
And when you find the person that you trust and you love
And you feel is going to respect you and take all of the shit you have and turn it around and bring out the best in you and feed you
It is the most powerful thing you can feel in your life
Happiness comes from you
No one else can make you happy
You make you happy
And one thing that's for sure:
The love I have for music, for my husband, for my child,
Is something that will last far beyond my life
OMG, you done lost yo' motherfreakin' mind!
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind
I could shed so many tears
But I won't let you see me crying
Now it all adds up
Even the numbers
Let me exactly hear
But you you wonder
I know how my mama felt
Getting ran over
But this ain't a cycle here
This one is over
Something told me to check my time
If I'm the one that's always crying
Now that it's over
I can move on from here
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
I could've told ya
It's all in the atmosphere
I can't control ya
But I'm not a pushover no more
You could shed so many tears
But you won't let me see you crying
If she really loves ya
Than that's what ya need to build
I'm more than your woman
I know you don't love her
I painted it for ya
But you picked the colors
At night you'll get over
Yeah, like you will never
I trusted you through all these years
And I'm the one that's always crying
The melody told ya
Exactly the pain I feel
Reap what you sow, boy
I'm not a pushover
You must've just lost yo mind (You lost it)
I always knew you were counterfeit
That's what you get
I see you crying
Excuses after excuses
Pretending that we exclusive
I stuck around all these years
I dried and cried all your tears
I trusted you despite my fears
And I refuse to keep on trying
I can move over
You just confirmed it
This ain't a warning
Been living a double life
(You crazy!)
They told me 'bout all the lies
(You lost yo mind!)
(Tell ya one more time!)
You must have lost yo mind!
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine
(It was not mine!)
Many earrings must I find?
(Hey!)
You just lost yo mind
As a result of the public release of the elevator security footage from Monday, May 5th, there has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it. Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family
He's always laughing
And flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact
You've been real distant lately
Acting like I'm not even there
He says that you
Don't deserve a girl like me
I'm starting to think that he's right
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (Baby)
Why is that when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I try to chill with you
Dance or whatever
And your homeboy's more interested than you?
He pays more attention to me than you lately
I'm tempted to pay attention too
Boy, when I try to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
When you want some loving
That's when its cool
But baby boy, I'm not a fool
You never wanted me (Wanted me)
Let this happen and it proves (No, no)
That your love was never true (No, no)
(How could you let him take your woman?)
Let this happen and it proves (Just let me go)
That your love was never true (Let me go)
If you let him take me from you (Just let me know)
Pure players
Slowly as Sir Luscious step up like a Q-Dawg
A-town's up, deuces down it's the new call
And you can dial 1-888-cut-something
I'm your kinky operator when you wanna fuck something
Ain't no dial tones just milestones, of pleasure to reach
To each his own, I'm a stone cold Aquarian freak
Humanitarian, barbarian, but under the sheets
It's the player from the point
And your girl from the D
Are you infatuated with me?
I could end your curiosity
If you don't think I'm too rude
Here's your chance to make your move
I sit and wait for nobody
People say that my, my style is so crazy
I think you like it, baby
Do you want to get nasty?
I dare you to undress me
Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With a hip hop star
Bamboos on, pants down low
I'm a rock star
Baby, let me know if you wanna ride with a
Hip hop star
Do I blow you away?
Do I stimulate your mind?
Would you taste my love if I give you time?
I have none to waste with you
I guess you can say
My style is so crazy
Undress me undress me
You can come
Come baby, undress me
Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers
The girls all pause, got them drippin' down they sugar walls
Aw naw! Getting to the nappy root
Knocking boots in stilettos, damn I keep it ghetto!
A cool type of fellow, mellow got the gold medal
Never settle for less my rose petal
Tooey, tooey, tooey, tooey! spit game!
Venom to get it up in 'em, let me "p" pop that thang
First check her brain to see if she's sane
Deranged or strange or crazy as hell
You never can tell these days
Everybody got a little Rick James in they veins man!
The way I feel
Oh girl I know its bout to be
Me all over you
And damn girl you all over me
Si yo fuera un chico
Sólo por una vez
Yo me vestiría como quiero
Con lo que vea primero y me voy
Saldría a buscar
Chicas por montón
Mis amigos que son leales
Siempre van a acompañarme hasta el fin
Cada noche a mentir
Sé que podría saber
Comprender mucho mejor
Lo que es amar a una mujer
Sabría escuchar
Pues conozco el dolor
De perder a quien se quiere
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasó
Pero ves no lo soy
Los chicos son de un molde
Y nosotras somos de corazón
Se piensan que son
Los del sexo superior
Pero cuando lo queremos
Nos vence nuestra seducción
Es muy tarde ya ves para regresar
Perdonarte otra vez ya no lo vas a lograr
El lugar que ocupabas tú, ya no está más
Pero eres un chico
Que le vas a hacer
No puedes comprender
Que se siente al comprender mejor
Y amar en serio a una mujer
No sabes escuchar
No te importa el dolor
Hasta que pierdes a quien quieres
This is just another day that I would spend waitin' for the right one
Staring at the night, and wishin' I could be the one to feel the warm sun...
You're a dream, but I'm wide awake;
I'm in Heaven, for Heaven's sake...
So get ready (get ready), I'm ready now (get ready);
I could never need you more than now...
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
Hold on to you tight, for once in my life...
This kind of love, you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime...
Tell me that you're living in a place where no one else can find you;
Tell me that you're singing out my name, hoping that I'll hear you...
Tell me "no", and I'll fade away
But this is lovin' that I won't waste...
"What are the words I'm needin' to hear?"
"How do I know if I'll ever love again?"
Seeing your face makes everything clear... (clear...) clear
And I'll never be the same...
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo' average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't yo average chick--back up
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
Everybody know that face
Even with her head low, they still know that shape
When she come through the club, people take they place
Chicks throwin' handcuffs 'cause they knowin' that they man ain't safe
'Cause she the one switchin' up flows
If it's four door, two gotta go
Chicks like, what kinda jeans is those?
And fellas watchin' like, please, get low
Everybody can't do this
Some ain't gotta clue till they hear me spit
Achoo, I spew 'cause yo' girl is sick
Is it the change or the hips--you can't tell, but you know it's thick
For this type of girl it's not that hard
You see her 'cause she too far gone
Though they pray and pray for her downfall
Why they gotta be so envious?
Doin' what it do fit to be a plus
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Back up, back up
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Back it up now
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ven y quédate conmigo
Dame el corazón vida mía estoy muriendo lento en mi prisión
Anda dime lo que sientes quitate el pudor
Y deja de sufrir, escapa con mi amor
Y después te llevare hasta donde quieras sin temor y sin fronteras hasta donde sale el sol
Contigo soy capaz de lo que sea
No me importa lo que venga
Porque ya se a donde voy
Soy tu gitano, tu peregrino
La única llave de tu destino
El que te cuida más que a su vida
Soy tu ladrón
Soy tu gitana, tu compañera
La que te sigue, la que te espera
Voy a quererte aunque me saquen el corazón
Y aunque nos cueste la vida
Y aunque duela lo que duela
Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor
Yo nací para tus ojos, para nadie más
Siempre voy a estar en tu camino
Alma de mi alma, corazón de tempestad
Dime por donde ir
Y después te llevare hasta donde quiera
Sin temor y sin fronteras hasta donde sale el sol
No me importa lo que venga porque ya se a donde voy
Esta guerra la ha ganado
Nuestro amor

HEY!!!!!!
It's really been weighing on me
Tell me what did I do?
To have ya'll hatin on me
When I don't have nothin' to prove
Sometimes I shake my head
When I'm layin' down in my bed
Thinkin' 'bout the things been said
When you really don't know me yet
Gotta clear up some things
There have been many things said about me!
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconcieved
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya
Give it a rest
You must admire me
Spend so much time with me consuming your head
(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies
No more, no more, no more, oooh
I'm not myself lately
I feel a little incomplete
But i'm not gonna lose no sleep
I keep it all in my mind
Cause it gotta get better in time
Why don't you live your life?
And let me live mine
Yoou, yoou, yoou, don't know
Why my name always in your mouth?
Leave me alone, leave me alone, just leave me alone, leave me alone ...
I met this girl, named Nicki
I guess you could say, she was the rap queen
I met her in the studio lobby
But her booty look bigger in the magazines
She said, "Bey, would you jump in this song of mine?"
How could I resist?
When I heard little Nicki rhyme
Deena (The Dreams)
We didn't make forever
We've each got to go our seperate way
And now we're standing here, helpless
Looking for something to say
We've been together a long time
We never thought it would end
We were always so close to each other;
You were always my friend
And it's hard to say good-bye, my love
Hard to see you cry, my love
Hard to open up that door
When you're not sure what you're going for
We didn't want this to happen
But we shouldn't feel sad
We had a good life together
Just remember, remember, all the times we had
You know I'll always love you
You know I'll always care
And no matter I'll far I may go
In my heart you'll always be there
And it's hard to say good-bye, my love (It's so hard)
Hard to see you cry, my love (It's so hard)
But we've got to grow
We've got to try
Though it's hard so hard
We've got to say goodbye
(We didn't make forever, but I'll always love you)
But I'll always love you
(It's so hard, baby it's so hard)
Hard...
Trust in me in all you do, have the faith I have in you
Love will see us through if only you trust in me
Why don't you, you trust me?
Come to me when things go wrong
Cling to me daddy and oh yeah I'll be strong
We can get along, we can get along
Oh, if only you trust in me
While there's a moon, a moon on high
While there are birds, birds to fly
While there is you, you and I
I can be sure that I love you
Oh, stand beside me, stand beside me all the while
Come on daddy face the future, why don't you smile?
Trust in me and I'll be worthy of you
Oh yeah, yeah, why don't you, yeah trust in me in all you do
And have the faith that I have in you?
Oh, and love will see us through if only you will trust in me
Why don't you, you come to me when things go wrong?
Cling to me oh and I'll be strong
We can get along, we can get along, oh if only you trust in me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, only if you trust in me
When I'm here in your arms, I feel love in my heart, I can breathe
Not even pinching myself, I don't care, I'm with you, you with me
I never wished on the star when the star ain't got nothing on me
'Cause I can wish you in my dreams
When I close my eyes, I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep, knowing that tonight you'll be here with me
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Ohh
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe (About you, babe)
So I'd rather be a dreamer than waking up with nobody home
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh)
If that's the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I think the luckiest girl in the whole wide world could be me
I get to be with the one that I love anytime I please
I feel like I can stay forever beyond eternity
It's like I'm where I'm supposed to be
It took a lifetime just to get with you, to be with you, baby
And now that I'm here with you, I'm gonna take it in, breathe you in
And if I am dreaming, let the dream be that I'm awake
'Cause I'd rather dream about you than living life without me and you, you
If tomorrow all the things were gone
Id worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my family by my side
Id thank my lucky stars, to be livin' here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston, to New York to L.A
Well there's pride in every American heart
And it's time to make a change
That I'm proud to be an American
And who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up, next to you and defend her still today
And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you
I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe
I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me with promises again
I know
When I'm deep Inside of me
Don't be too concerned
I won't ask For nothin'
While I'm gone
But when I want sincerity
Tell me, where else can I turn?
Because you're the one that I depend upon
TO MY DEAREST FANS in ANTWERP

We need to stop buying into the myth about gender equality
. 
It isn’t a reality yet. Today, women make up half of the U.S. workforce, but the average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes
But unless women and men both say this is unacceptable, things will not change.
Men have to demand that their wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters earn more— commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender.
Equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect
Humanity requires both men and women, and we are equally important and need one another. So why are we viewed as less than equal?
These old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning.
We have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect, so that as they grow up, gender equality becomes a natural way of life.
And we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible
We have a lot of work to do, but we can get there if we work together.
Women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters
. We must demand that we all receive 100 percent of the opportunities
Solid gold
It's gold

He's got the Midas touch, but he touched it too much
Hey, Goldmember

Goldie goldie goldie gold gold gold
You're gettin' down tonight, you're dynamite
'Cause that's the way, uh huh, uh huh, he likes it, uh huh, uh huh
Goldmember, Goldmember
He loves it, he loves it
He's from The Netherlands, and that's where he learned to dance
Oye, lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo así
Oye (uhum) como llora mi canción
Preciso tu atención, debes oir
Hoy no se quien soy ni se adonde voy
Encontrarme hoy es mi misión
De tu prisón por fin ya soy libre
Oye
Esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar a mi corazón
Hoy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor voy a partir
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz
Nunca quisiste que me fuera a volar
Callar mi identidad, que gran error
Hoy grito no tengo más temor
Hoy tu alumna te dice adiós
De tu prisión por fin ya soy libre
Yo soy tu gran creación
Por eso es que me voy
Dime adiós, dime adiós
Lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo asi
Ya me voy
Llena de valor hoy me ire sin ti
Mi voz!

Oooh Oooooh
Oooh Oooh
On A star
And I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes
And I'm wishing on our love, the things we never done
I never thought I'd see a time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moments that we can spend
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know
In the game of love, you reap what you sow
I feel it's time we should make up baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together
Whether or never
(Let's get together, baby)
And I'm wishin on a star
And I'm wishing on a dream
The cards never lie, my last breath a sigh
And now I think about if it's my time to die
I don't know what I was thinking, steady wasting time with Hill
And I need to live my life because my time is unforgiven
I can't understand how my life changed around
Manifest my destiny, is it the brown underground?
Blue skies are turning gray it's the point of indecision
Believing in the cards you must respect its every vision
Girlfriend, get your mind on line
Don't spend your time cause you can't waste your time
Everyday like it's your last, but you must feel divine
Intervention comes and snatch up all your dreams from behind
Love!
You feel it and you got to let them know it
Your heart and that's the feeling that you go with
If you have a dream you need to go and let them know it
Cause you could wake up in the morning and it could be over
No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
Carmen, don't listen cause the cards have deceit
Just slide him the money, we don't need a receipt
Truth only exists within the eyes of the beholder
Plus he's kind of young for fortune telling
He probably should be older
But the cards never lie, I thought I told you
Now it's her turn to try, to reach her goals before she reaches the sky
This is love
It's like I'm trying to throw my life away
Sometimes love is all you got and other times it makes you pay
Well when you finally rise
Then you'll realize
The windows to the soul are not the hips but the eyes
Oh You could wish on the stars but they're dead, just a lie
But they shine just as bright as they did their entire life
Let me live my dreams, let me see another dawn
Just let me live my dreams, let me see another dawn
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
En el closet, en un rincón están tus cosas
Esto se acabó (se acabó)
Te juro que no te aguanto más
No te quiero ya ni como amante
Esta vez no ganarás
Te puedes marchar y no vuelvas jamás
Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate…
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
A olvidar tu amor…
Ya me curé del dolor
Ya te saqué de mi corazón
Vete con ella, solos los dos
Pobre de ti, lárgate me das asco
Tú eras mi luz, pero hay amores que matan de daño
Me cansé de ti
Ya no soy aquella infeliz
Voy a olvidar tu amor (voy a olvidar tu amor…)
Ya no soy nada para ti (voy a olvidar tu amor…)
Alguien que no conoces (conoces…)
Lo nuestro se acabó (se acabó…)
Tanto daño al fin lo destruyó (destruyó…)
Nunca lloraré por ti (lloraré por ti)
Porque ya me cansé de ti (ya me cansé de ti)
No eres más imprescindible
Hum…
Voy a olvidar tu amor
¿Qué sabes tú de mí? (baby…)
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme
(¿Qué sabes tú de mí?)
No hay más que hablar, terminamos
(No me hagas reír)
Este cuento al fin se ha acabado
Voy a olvidar tu amor…
I read all of the magazines
While waiting around
You said you couldn't wait to see me
But you got stuck in town
So turn off the phone

And some moments at the end of the day
Feel your touch and it's the sweetest
Your kisses are my weakness

Your kisses are delicious
And no one is gonna miss us

Club is about to close
Gimme one more dance and I'm ready to go

I'll go and tell my girls
If you go and tell your boys
(What's it gonna be boy)

(Tell me what's it gonna be)
Feel like I'm loosing my mind
Love is so hard to find
You led me on to believe you belong to me
Oh oh
I'm going through difficult times
I always thought you were mine
Love doesn't feel like this
This is my final wish
Hook:
The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please don't stop in front of me
Cause your loves no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back your hand
You know your not what I need
Let me go Let me do B
Chorus:
You've got me chasing after you like an
Ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It always out of luck
(And my heart just melts)
It's always out of luck
(And mt heart just melts)
Verse 2:
Faster and faster I ran
You sped up and then
Just as I thought I've caught up
I'm chasing you again
Finally
You stopped and I jumped on
I realized the flavor was wrong
You thought I was still holdin on
It's good to know what's goin on
The next your truck rolls by
Bridge:
You got me
Chasin you
I try my luck
I can't catch up
Cuz you got me
My hearts melting
It's like ice cream
My heart's melting
Bridge ending:
I've been chasin after you
Now it's time to let you go
Yes I try time and time again
You don't love me
It's got to end
I tried so hard
Damn there lost my mind
Cuz real love is hard to find
Now my heart can't take no more
Now I know boy you ain't mine
Square-cut or pear shaped
These rocks don't lose their shape
Diamonds are a girls best friend
Diamonds, diamonds
I don't mean rhinestones
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
If this what you truly want
I can  her skin over mine
Her hair over mine
Her hands as gloves
Her teeth as confetti
Hey Honey

Mr. Comedian Jokes On You And
You Good At Bet So Where's My Money
I Know You Bet That I'd Never Make Move
So Whys The House Empty
Lights Off By The End Of This Week
I Leave Wit Wat I Came Wit Baby
I Take The Dogs You Keep The Mercedes
Cause I'm gone I'm not fazed
I walk these roads with grace
And I'll wave with you behind me
With a new smile on my face
Cause I'm walking in new shoes now
I got a new song to sing
When I walk in the room every head turns
Every eye is on me
To bad you're not here to see it
And by the time you get this
I'll be so long gone and far
I'll send you a postcard
Aaha I'll send you a postcard
Hey baby
You seen a ghost?
This ain't yo lady
This is the chick that you held back
Now all of the things you've said were crazy
I checked out my list and I feel good about it
I got the new haircut
The one that you said wouldn't look no good
Took that job you said I could not get
Wore that dress you said I'd never fit
Cause you're gone and I'm great
I got rid of your dead weight
And I'll wave at you behind me
Party the people, the people the party
It's popping no sitting around

I look at what you started now

Come one give some of the that stuff
Let me freshin' it up little one on one with no ruff (let's go)
You are, Black Culture
We are, Black Culture
There's a moment where things click. When I was in the studio I was threading the songs together and I...thought of this performance which was a really defining moment in my life as a child. In my mind we would perform on Star Search, we would win; we would get a record deal and that was my dream at the time. There's no way in the world I would ever imagine losing as a possbility. You know, I was only 9 years old so, at that time, you don't realise that you could actually work super hard and give everything you have and lose! It was the best message for me. When I put Ed MacMahon introducing us as "the Hip-Hop rapping Girls' TYME" it clicked something in my mind. I feel like something about the aggression of Bow Down and the attitude of Flawless - the reality is, sometimes you lose. And you're never too good to lose, you're never too big to lose, you're never too smart to lose; it happens, and it happens when it needs to happen. And you have to embrace those things
I was scrolling through videos about feminism on YouTube and I ran across this video of this incredible Nigerian author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Everything she said is exactly how I feel
My message behind this album is finding the beauty in imperfection. I had this image of this trophy and me accepting these awards and kind of training myself to be this champion. And at the end of the day when you go through all of these things, is it worth it? I mean, you get this trophy and you're like, 'I basically starved, I have neglected all of the people that I love, I've conformed to what everybody else thinks I should be and I have this trophy. What does that mean?'. The trophy represents all of the sacrafices I made as a kid. All of the time that I lost, being on the road/ in the studios as a child. And, I just wanna throw that shit up
I have a lot of awards and I have a lot of these things that I'm amazing and I'm - I worked my ass of, I worked harder then probably everybody I know to get those things but nothing feels like my child saying 'Mommy'. No, nothing feels like when I look at my husband in the eyes, nothing feels like when I'm respected, when I get on the stage and I see I'm changing people's lives. Those are the things that matter and, at this point in my life, that's what I'm striving for. Growth, love, happiness, fun; enjoying your life, it's short - that's the message
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
It's 6 o'clock
And seconds feel like hours as I sit here
And watch them tick away
And just the thought
Of seeing you again I wanna sing
I've been longing for this day
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't smile untill I see your smile
There's nothing else that I would rather do
'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
'Cause patiently I'll wait right here for you
Patiently I'll wait right here for you
Patiently I wait
It's 12 am
The crowd is getting thin but it's okay
'Cause I'm not here for them no, no, no
And I refuse
To move from the spot
Until I feel your heart
Pressed against mine again
I'm waiting!
'Cause I can't smile until I see your smile
I don't care how long it takes
I don't mind I'm alright I'll sit and wait
'Til the sun comes down and rise
And come right back up again
You're the best thing that's happened in my life
When your absent in the borders is my life
And it just ain't right
So take as long as you like
I'm waiting
I can't smile until I see your smile
I can't sleep until I hear your heart
'Cause patiently I wait right here for you
Patiently I wait right here for you
All in all you've been there for me
You showed me things I would never see
I think I'm ready
By my side you been waitin'
Respectfully and oh so patient
I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control you haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And that's why
Baby, I'm not afraid to go the way
But it's my first time
And baby, I know you wanna change the speed
And I'ma let you take the lead but it's my first time
And baby, I'm not afraid to go the way
And baby I know you wanna change the speed
And I'ma let you take the lead remember it's my first time
Arm in arm eye to eye
As the music plays emotions rise
In your eyes I see three words
Hold me tight 'cause I'm about to burst
(It's my first time
Remember your first time
It's my first time)
It felt like
I gotta give up to quiet
The storm that rages inside
The way that I hid my damage pride
You gave me away
And I've had enough
I imagine the words I say to you
I'm finding strength to follow it through
I'm ready to change
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, we're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We'll only find ourselves by losing all
Control, control, control, control
I'm opening up
Show me a sign I can't believe
These crazy emotions flow through me
I'm gonna explode, oh
You take me away
And what is my ordinary life
I won't be afraid of what we might find a love I can hold
We'll only find ourselves by losing all, no
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
New horizon ready to paint
With every breath, you take me away
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Michelle,
Is the ULTIMATE example of a truly strong
African American woman.
She is a caring mother, she's a loving wife,
while at the same time, she is the FIRST LADY!!!!
No matter the pressure, and stress of being
under the microscope - she is humble, loving and
sincere.
She builds and nurtures her family, while also
looking out for so many millions in so many ways
Michelle, thank you so much for every single
thing that u do for us - I am PROUD to have
my daughter grow up in a world where she has
people like you, to look upto.
I always loved you
Even though you did me wrong
I always stayed by your side
I guess I was your fool
I always cared
There's no one above you
I swear
Cheated on me now she's there
She won't answer your calls
Don't wanna be bothered at all
I guess I'll be the one standing with open arms
Sucker for love
Kisses too
Your touch, I'm crazy for you
I'll settle for you
Yes
I will be
The one who will
Settle for you
The one you run to
You come running to
I can never leave you
No matter how hard I try
You'll probably do it again
I'll still be right here waiting
Nothing has changed
It remains
The same
I can't explain
Your kisses too
Even
When the chips
Are down
I'll still
You'll probably
Hurt me again
I know I must be
The world's
Greatest fool
I will always
Love you
No matter how
Hard I try
Probably
Do it again
I'll still be
Here waiting
Stuck with you
In love with you
Here for you
Loving you
Settling for you
Baby, yea
It really hurts to say this yes it does
But after a while sweet love just ain't enough
So many settle for less just because
Maybe I'm more in love with what it was
But what's gets so confusing baby
It's been so much confusion lately
You couldn't see that you were losing me
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company
Won't you just assume he doesn't care
To internalize it all isn't fare
So I address the problem so that he's aware
But I still feel all alone even when he's there
Maybe we can fix it baby
I know we can
If I make you miss it baby
Then maybe you will understand
That I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I wanted to give all of my fans something extra because this album was so special to me. And it came so effortlessly after I finished the film of my life, "Dreamgirls". Because I was so inspired by Deena, I wrote songs that were saying all the things I wish she would have said in the film. And I wanted to give you an extra special song that Deena sings. It's a pivotal moment when Deena finally does get the strength to stand up for herself and does know who she is and knows what she wants. I'm sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics. This is "Listen"...
You know you really, really, really, really
Want to be with me
So why don't you stop beating around the bush
And come and give it to me
Derek we can make beautiful music together
If you only stop resisting the only woman that you really want
And its not wifey
Hey! You're real social
I don't like the way you're looking
Don't get too close
I'm about to take you down to booking
C'mon and touch me D I know you want to
Look, I only need your prints
Don't really care about your frontal
I don't see me living another day
Without your tender kisses
Why don't we retire to the room
Put on some Luther, light some incents
Get to know one another just a little better
Than we do now
You trying to act like I'm not a cop
You can bring the cuffs, if you would like to
If that's your style
Looks let's get it straight, you cease and disist
I got some platinum bracelets
I'm about to squeeze on ya wrists
But you don't understand the way that I feel
The pain I could heal
I could lose my job for this
There is no way we could chill
So why you bring me this far
Now let's try to be real
Cause only time will reveal
If you still playing the field
Every second that you stay is like an hour we will
I got a couple days to kill
Either you down or you peel
I don't want anything without you in my life
You are my baby
Why don't you forget about your girl
And say you want me as your lady
Give in to everything you're feeling that's surprising
Let's make love now
Nah, I don't think so
Your body is like weed smoke though
Light-headed, feel ya eyes saying please don't go
It ain't about getting locked
Cause it's your steeze I need
My heart don't lie, come over D and feel my beat
Oh no! Cause I can see your skin is soft
You know, but I dont wanna pay the cost to be with you
You can't deny your feelings for us
You know it's true
I gotta go, but really now I'm feeling you
I wanna do it, but I don't
You know, I'd feel your thigh, but I'm so full of decency
Go with your instincts and I'm sure it leads to me
There's only moments to see if it is to be...
Baby, you're the only man that I want
Baby, you're the only man that I love
Baby, you're the only man that truly makes me happy
So happy
I'm so happy I met you
It's been a crazy afternoon
And I can't wait till I get home to you
Cause I've been thinking about you all day long
I hope you miss me boy, cause here I come
Boy, I love the way you move
And I love fallin' back in love with you
Sometimes I wonder how it feels to be as beautiful as you
It's not over baby, I'm so happy I met you
Oh, I love the things you do
Baby you're the only you I can get close to you
The thought I fell in love with you
You got the qualities I've been lookin' for
So glad I found you
I'm so dangerously in love with you
I feel the same when I'm with chu boo
You're so good to me
And that's why I'm happy I met you
Put a smile on my face

But I saw something else I like
And I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next (oh oh)
Today when I wake up
You didn't look the same as last night
And it just don't feel right anymore
I think that we should break up
There's no reason to make up
I won't fight
I'm just tired and I need a change
Sorry, boy
But you got me bored
And something's catching my eye
I was only satisfied
For a little while
I gotta
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out (woah oh ho-ooh ooh)
You call me too frequently
I thought it was so sweet in the beginning
But now you're too clingy for me
You don't put the seat down
You don't clean the house how I like it (trifling)
That's risen enough
You're time's expired
I gotta move around
If I ain't got a ring by now
That means I'm not tied down
But I saw something else that I like
I really think I gotta make you my next ex
Woah oh
Woah woah woah
Woah oh oh oh oh
Woah-ho oh
Woah oh oh oh
But then I seen something else that I like
I like to feel so high and
You feel good feeling low
I like my colors vivid
And you paint your colors gold
I like to see the world
And you like your weekends home
But I've been staying behind
While you refused to go
Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign
You like to sleep all day and I like my minutes
I like trips to the movies you watch tv all night long
I like to go out dancing and you go out just to hang
And I've been right beside you losing me
And doing the same
I looked around and baby you were gone
Where did I lose you honey
I even slowed down thought you'd follow
But you took your own roads honey
Cause I've been traveling traveling traveling
Only to find that
I'm making this trip alone
And I've been staying behind
MUSIC CUE: MINE
Took a trip to clear my mind
And you're still so fine, oh my oh my
Are we gonna even make it? Oooh
Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Know you wanna roll with a good girl?
Don't sleep when you know you got it good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
Wassup
On my mind up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away

We should get married

I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in the club
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body
Been serving all this, swerve, surfing all in this good, good
Yeah, MTV!
MUSIC CUE: ROCKET
Let me sit this ass on you
Show you how I feel
Let me take this off
Will you watch me?
That's mass appeal
Don't take your eyes
Don't take your eyes off it
If you like you can touch it, baby
Do you, do you wanna touch it, baby?
Hard rock, steady rock
Hard rock, steady rock-rock
MUSIC CUE: PARTITION
I don't need you seeing Yoncé on her knees
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
Oh, there daddy, daddy didn't bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby be better slow it down
And we ain't even gonna make it to this club
I just wanna be the girl you like (girl you like)
The kinda girl you like (girl you like)
Right here with me
MUSIC CUE: SUPERPOWER
We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls:
"You can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful
But not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man."
Feminist: the person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes."
MUSIC CUE: ***FLAWLESS
H, H-town, town, I’m coming down

Respect that, bow down bitches (Crown!)
Bow down bitches, bow bow down bitches (Crown)
H-Town vicious
H, H-Town vicious
I'm so crown, crown, bow down bitches
I'm out that H-town, coming, coming down

Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My rock, flawless
I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say I look so good tonight
God damn, God damn, God damn
MUSIC CUE: FLAWLESS (REMIX)
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Ha, ha, God damn, God damn, God damn
MUSIC CUE: YONCÉ
Drop the bass, mayne, the bass get lower
Radio say, "Speed it up," I just go slower

MUSIC CUE: BLUE

MUSIC CUE: XO
Your love is bright as ever 2x
Even in the shadows 2x
So baby, kiss me 2x
Before they turn the lights out 2x
Baby love me lights out
In the darkest night hour (in the darkest night hour)
I'm gonna give you everything
Everybody on your feet 2x
Sing ! Imma say
Oooooh ooooh ooooh ooooh 2x
Now put your hands together
Thank you so much, I love you all
When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you
I didn't want no man
I didn't wanna fall in love, and
I didn't care about your girl
I didn't care how we would end up
But that was then, this is now
I think I'm experiencing love
I don't wanna wreck up your home
That's why I'm convinced, I gotta go
Everytime she calls, you expect
Me to disappear like we never met
At first I didn't mind, but now I
Sometimes feel like you're all mine
You told me it was all about me, me
It's not about me if your still with her
Now I've realized that I've gotta move on
It might be hard, but I
I gotta move on
I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)
Chorus
 Yo where the brother by my side at?
 Yo you really need to stop that
 Get it right!
 It's not even like that
 Try to get a job before we livin outta box black
Put it on that and here's ya demo you can shop dat
It's funny how things turn around
Last night you tryna get down you act like you down
Any other time it's like you steady hatin on Brown
I'm tryna see my name in lights you tryna short  out the ground
You're the one that's got it twisted cause I'm right by your side
I had a bad day you jumpin' on my back for a ride
What can a man say I'm on the run, just for your auditionin
Callin on you every night it's like you never listenin
You're the one that's switchin up gettin to specifics
When you say that I'm just dreamin I be rollin like a Michelin
Carmen you just trippin cause you know I love you infinite
Just so we could be here look at everything I did for this
So why you actin like that
You don't have to take it anymore fight back
I came to far to turn around and just hike back
Trying to get me sidetracked see me on the corner where the sign of the time
At
Chorus x2
And yo I came from the projects now I want the condos
Trying to be a star and now you messin up my cosmos
But you can't find something if you walkin' wit a blindfold
Carmen I can see right through you with my eyes closed
Grown man to finance
You actin like a nuisance
You're the one that's in the club and tryin to do a new dance
Songs you got me singin like my name was Bobbly Blubland
Don't make me sing 'em cause the game you playin baby two can
You're all alone
I did this
I got no one else to blame
You didn't know
I was a risk
And it's such a crying shame
How you gave me all of you and wanted nothing else from me
But to make some time for you but all I made you was lonely
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
I should've been there
All of the times
You used to cry
Because I would let you down
I'm losing time
I should've tried
A little more to be around
But I didn't know that you were hurting, I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain: another you I'll never find
I'm filled with regret
I'm gonna tip and sew myself in misery
Now in your life
I'll take more time
No more yearning without me
But it hurts to think of you all by yourself but now I see
And I apologize for all the times I left you home waiting for me
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there) 
I'm gonna be there
You say that hes wrong you say that he's no good
Leave him alone cuz he's gona hurt you
But what they don't know is how he makes me feel
You say that he creeps always runnin the streets
He's playin the game and he'll never love me
You say that he's fake but why does it feel so real
No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think ima always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
No matter what your fearin its all in the past
No matter what your feelin this love is gon' last
The heart and the soul it breathes inside of me
My man (he makes me feel so special)
My Man (he makes me feel so precious)
My Man (he makes me feel wonderful)
My Man (im feelin so comfortable)
He's the guy oh he's my man
You say you dont trust him b/c he been locked up
You say that he's trouble cuz he out in the strip club
But you were young once so you should understand
You say that you know, so you been a witness
You say its for sure so he got a mistress
Until you can show me im gon' stand by him

Thank you so much. Hi, baby. Thank you to the Grammy voters for the incredible honor. Thank you to everyone who worked so hard to beautifully capture the profundity of deep southern culture. I thank god for my family, my wonderful husband, my beautiful daughter my fans for bringing me so much happiness and support. We all experience pain and loss, and often we become inaudible. My intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that would give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness and our history. To confront issues that make us uncomfortable. It's important to show images to my children to reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first at their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the white house and the Grammy's and see themselves and have no doubt that they're beautiful, intelligent and capable. This is something I want for every child of every race, and I feel its vital that we learn from the past and recognize our tendencies to repeat our mistakes. Thank you again for honoring 
Lemonade
. Have a beautiful evening. Thank you for tonight, this is incredible
Look what you've done to me
I'm losing my mind
You've got the best of me
And it feels so right
You've got a way you work me
It's workin me I
I can't help my emotions when you're dancin close to me
Sexually healin come and rescue me
(Come and rescue me)
Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
Cause the way that he move got a girl wanna do something
There's only one of you
Cause you're the real deal
I'm wearing the ring if you feel the way I feel
I'm trying hard to fight your sexual appeal
You be sayin'
No no no no no
When it's really
Yes yes yes yes yes
(x 4)
Boy I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin'
Why don't you say what's on your mind
'Cause each and everytime
You're near me
You give me signs
But when I ask you "What's the deal?"
You're holdin' it all inside
If you wanna' be with me
You gotta' keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on
Tell me how you feel
Just as much as I want you
So come get my love
All here for you
Everytime I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care
Bug a boo(talk)
You buggin' what?
You buggin' Who?
You buggin' me
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug-a boo, a bug-a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my e-mail stop
Can you pay my bills
Can you pay my telephone bills
Can you pay my automo-bills
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
If you ain't runnin game
Better say my name!
Any other day I would call
You would say, baby how's your day?
But today it ain't the same
Every other word is
Uh huh, yeah okay
Could it be that you
Are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there first of all
Let me say, I am not the one
To sit around and be played
Why do you feel you gotta lie?
Gettin' caught up in your'one game
When you can not say my name
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be a reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who
(all my DC's fans!)
(yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea)
Ladies leave yo man at home(3x)
Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'
Bounce baby, bounce, bo-bounce bounce, bo-bounce
Twirk it, twirk it
Shake baby, shake sha-shake shake
Work it, work it
Twist baby, twist tw-twist
You better dip that thing

Question: Tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your cell-y when I'm feelin lonely
When it's all over please get up and leave
Question: Tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me boy you get dismissed
Pay my own fun, oh and I pay my own bills
Always 50/50 in relationships
The shoes on my feet
I bought it
The clothes I'm wearing
The rock I'm rockin'
'Cause I depend on me
If I want it
The watch I'm wearin'
The house I live in
The car I'm driving
Cause I depend on me
(I depend on me)
All the women who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
All the mommas who profit dollas
All the ladies who truly feel me
Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyoncé, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this! (WHOO!)
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this!
Now that you're out of my life
I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you
But I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you
But I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you
I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you
Now I'm wiser
Though that I'd be helpless without you
But I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you
But I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you
Sold 9 million
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm not gon give up
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'
I'm a survivor!!
Every step I make
And every breath I take
I took 'cause I can't wait
To be closer to you
Baby you're so sweet
You give me cavities
I get a stomach ache
If I can't be with you
At night I fall asleep
And I dont wanna wake up
'cause you are in my dreams
A heavenly creation
In the body that
I only wanna share with you
Everything I do is just for you
Countin every second til we rendezvous
And I can't wait
To give my love to you
'cause everything I do is just for you
Baby we will never finish
To be continued
Separation can't change
The love I feel for you

Snuggle up tonight lets get real intimate
Only you can satisfy my appetite

I wanna taste your lips
My body melts in bliss every time

[Intro: Lil Zane & 
T-Bone
Ah Yeah
Time to come back home y`all
Come on, come on, come on
[Verse 1: Lil Zane, 
For God I`m a slave To get to heaven Reverend said I gotta be saved
And behave And also stuck in my ways Give Him praise
Words can`t express what I feel inside of my flesh
Every breath is giving Him glory until my death
 (I feel blessed)
Cuz everyday I`m seeing Him work (I feel blessed)
I don`t wanna do no more dirt
If the path I was on was wrong (I feel blessed)
It`s time to come home
[Verse 2: Beyoncé, 
Melba Moore
 & 
Angie Stone
It doesn`t matter where you been Or what you did wrong
It doesn`t matter who you are  You`re always welcome
It only matters that your heart believes And you confess
If you committed any sin you`ll be forgiven
Callin on all of God`s children (Time to come home)
If you wanna be delivered (Time to come home)
I`ve been rescued by the Saviour (Time to come home)
If you wanna be in His favour (Time to come home)
Come on home
Come on come on home
Oooh yeah yeah
[Verse 3: Angie Stone, 
If you can`t see your way out And you`re drowning in your regrets
If you have everything you want
 But you still can`t find happiness
It`s when you feel like you`re forsaken Life can be
 so hopeless
Maybe you need to come home So your life can be cleansed
Don`t bare the burden all by yourself (By yourself)
The Redeemer`s here He`s gonna give you help (Give you help)
Come unto Him and He will give you rest
For any heart that`s heavy laden
Soul salvation, ooh
My home, Your home
In His everlasting arms
Dont you know its time to come home
Deliver me
I`ve been rescued by the Saviour
Dont you wanna be in His favour
Time to come home
Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the meaning to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay
Well, it's not my thing trying to get back
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
Everywhere you are
Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside
Any, any, anywhere you are
I gotta, gotta be where you are
I wanna be, I wanna be, I
Yeah, yeah, baby now
Na, na, yeah, yeah
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh I
Na, na, baby

Be straight up and tell me what's your aim
A Girl like me see I don't play no games, no no
That's why I say
If you wanna be with me go all the way
Do what you got to do, just let me state
Is it real or is this just a fake, tell me
What's good with you baby (wanna get to know me)
What's really good baby (do you have a lady)
Been near the hood lately (where you from and where you be)
What's good with you baby (what's you good with you baby)
You sittin over there tryna figure out what to say
Make up your mind right now don't contemplate
You know that I don't have time to waste, No Noo!

What this thing could be we'll never know
There is just no way that we can flow
If you ain't being honest from the go, Tell me

Been near the hood lately
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home;
Comin' for to carry me home
I looked over Jordan
And what did I see
A band of angels comin' after me
If you get there before I do
Tell all my friends I'm comin' too
I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted to one time to see you laughing
I only wanted to see you
Laughing in the purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Bathing in the purple rain
I never wanted to be your weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind of friend
Baby, I could never steal you from another
It's such a shame our friendship had to end
Honey, I know, I know
I know times are changing
It's time we all reach out
For something new, that means you too
You say you want a leader
But you can't seem to make up your mind
I think you better close it
And let me guide you to the purple rain
Step, step
Step on over
(Step on over, step on over)
Wanting you
(Wanting you)
Needing you
(Needing you)
Touching you
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Cause I know I don't understand
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me looking so crazy, your love
"Who he think he is?" look at what you did to me
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress
Just how the love your doing no one else can
I'm looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Cause your love's got the best of me
Cause baby you got me, you got me, so crazy, baby
HEY!
I see music. It's more than just...what I hear. When I'm connected to something, I immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or emotion. A memory from my childhood, thoughts about life, my dreams or my fantasies and they're all connected to the music. And I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do a visual album; I wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head, cause it's what makes it mine. That vision in my brain is what I want people to experience the first time
I feel like, right now, people experience music differently.
I remember seeing Thriller on TV with my family. It was an event; we all sat around the TV and now, looking back, I'm so lucky I was born around that time.
 I miss that...immersive experience. 
Now, people only listen to a few seconds of a song on their iPods - they don't really invest in a full album.
 It's all about the single and the hype, there's so much that gets between the music and the artist and the fans. I felt like 'I don't want anybody to give the message when my record is comnig out. I just want this to come out when it's ready and from me to my fans'. I told my team 'I wanna shoot a video for every song and put them all out at the same time', everyone thought I was crazy but we're actually doing it. It's happening
I wanted to make this body of work and, I feel like it's something that's lost in Pop music. I wanted people to hear things differently and have a different first impression. Not just listen to a ten second clip but see the whole vision of the album. It was important that we made this a movie, we made this an experience. I wanted everyone to see the whole picture and to see how personal everything is to me. I would make my best art and just put it out and that's-that's why it's out 
today
I live my life to the fullest
Party every chance I get
Friday nights, the Spot is the place i hit
Decked out, chestout
Me and my girls roll up at the Spot like we own the world
You should see the eyes on me, dress fittin like a prize on me
High split , fellas get the rise on me
Juss from the looks of it , I must say
Ya bound to get hooked , if you play
Your optomistic for someone goin to jail
Would you stop being so damn stale
I know you gotta girl but damn dont u wanna see new things
Security shouldn't purchase a ring
So why you lookin at me like that
Like what u say is tru?
I kno ya type I see through you
Oh yea? What u see??
Cause I love my girl it ain't about security I give her the world
Shes down for and always has been
And I would be too if I was your girlfriend
But Im not
I even take ya too the Spot, bring sand to the beach, keep u on a leash
I kno how most of these chicks could be
Sceemin and plottin on you like me
Listen, you a little too hot for a guy like me
My girl is mo' like me she juss coo ya kno?
Not a risk taker she just goes w/ the flow
Shes wack! Ya need a little spice in ya life
Live a little you'll see what u want in a wife is in me
I'm tellin you its like gold
Hard to let go, Harder to hold
I'll dance wit ya slowly, too a hip-hop joint
And only stop on a positive, you got the point?
I dont dance, i dont drink i dont like clubs im not impressed
I dont smoke, only scrubs go to different places and fall for pretty faces
To me ya'll are all basic
And ya life is wasted
Thats why u a cop
You never got to taste it if you had one drop
You wouldn't go back
I'll prove it to you
Come out wit me tonight, that'll do it for you!
WE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF THE KILLINGS OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES.
IT IS UP TO US TO TAKE A STAND AND DEMAND THAT THEY “STOP KILLING US.”
WE DON'T NEED SYMPATHY. WE NEED EVERYONE TO RESPECT OUR LIVES.
WE'RE GOING TO STAND UP AS A COMMUNITY AND FIGHT AGAINST ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THAT MURDER OR ANY VIOLENT ACTION BY THOSE WHO ARE SWORN TO PROTECT US SHOULD CONSISTENTLY GO UNPUNISHED.
THESE ROBBERIES OF LIVES MAKE US FEEL HELPLESS AND HOPELESS BUT WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE NEXT GENERATION, FOR THE NEXT YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO BELIEVE IN GOOD.
THIS IS A HUMAN FIGHT. NO MATTER YOUR RACE, GENDER OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. THIS IS A FIGHT FOR ANYONE WHO FEELS MARGINALIZED, WHO IS STRUGGLING FOR FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS.
THIS IS NOT A PLEA TO ALL POLICE OFFICERS BUT TOWARD ANY HUMAN BEING WHO FAILS TO VALUE LIFE. THE WAR ON PEOPLE OF COLOR AND ALL MINORITIES NEEDS TO BE OVER.
FEAR IS NOT AN EXCUSE. HATE WILL NOT WIN.
WE ALL HAVE THE POWER TO CHANNEL OUR ANGER AND FRUSTRATION INTO ACTION. WE MUST USE OUR VOICES TO CONTACT THE POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS IN OUR DISTRICTS AND DEMAND SOCIAL AND JUDICIAL CHANGES.
WHILE WE PRAY FOR THE FAMILIES OF ALTON STERLING AND PHILANDO CASTILE, WE WILL ALSO PRAY FOR AN END TO THIS PLAGUE OF INJUSTICE IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

Carmen why you bugin', this ain't time for lovin'

Big boy clubbing, no more this kid scrubbing, up in Roscoes grubbing
Keep the busiest commin'
You know he do cats and keep running staying on sunset
Air force oneing, You know me and Nicki got the duce on the sicky
Tripping cause the ready came at hit you with a hickey
You got the dreams, all we need is the beams
Nineteen, Nineteen
Ice cream, Vanilla bean
It might seem, but everything that glitters don't bling
I ain't ever net these brothers hows that the right thing
...
When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you
If your heart is in your dream, no request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star as dreamers do
It's H-O, light up the dro
Thats a no-go my dough keep the scales tippin'
Like 4-4s, like I'm from the H-
O-U-S-T-O-N
Go shorty, it's Beyonce
We gon' party like, it's ya birthday
We gettin' naughty like, it's ya birthday
So put ya drink up in the air if you feel sexy!
I'm the chick with the hot ish, manolo blahnik
Jimmy choo kicks, killin' it, who you with?
Me & my girls at the party with the diamond zinati's
I'm that classy mami with the Marilyn Monroe body
I'm that fly chick 5*6 Marc Jacob mini
Ghetto fabolous, glamourous, its effortless
Make up light, we with my pastel luis
Designer scarf, work of art, rockin' vintage Gucci
You can find me in the club, sippin' on some buds
Daddy I got what you need you's a sexy little thug
Don't wanna be your girl I ain't lookin for no love
So come give me a hug, sexy little thug
My nails my hair my diamond rings
Shining with all my fancy things
My crib my car my clothes my jewels
Why you mad? Cause I came up and I ain't changed
I'm that girl wearing chanel pearls
Chandeliers in my ears from Bailey Bank and Biddle
Ya feelin my style, ya feelin my flow
Hair sheek, smells sweet, like flow to flow?
I'm the lady sipping baileys while I strut like a model
If the ladies wanna hate me I jus send them a bottle
I kno I got it but don't flaunt it even though brothas want it
Dancin' dirrty while I'm flirtin, 'cause he' checkin' up on me
Why you mad? Cause I came up and I ain't changed, ohhh

We have our strength (we have)
Small bosses still in progress (we have)
As we say in BO$$ our great-great-grandchildren are already millionaires
Future numbers one on the Forbes list (one, one)
We're going to darken this list (we're going) I do not know what they will be when formed
Just follow Bonnie and Clyde
Dad and Mom are respected
Be like B and Jay Make it rain in the summer
Stop the world and steal it for you
You can small heirs (can)
With love B

Daddy, you've given me a taste of your honey
'Cause I had the sweetest time
You gotta work it out
Work it out

Stay out all night like it's 1996
Pull out that porsche tonight

I, I need my man
To feel like he's a man
To feel the need to question
Where is or who he's with
He's more than my man
He's my best friend
Don't feel the need to check on him
'Cause we got blind trust
Trust, trust, trust
We got blind trust
If we got blind trust
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
'Cause everywhere we lookin' now

You're everything we need and more
Haiti, we can feel your halo
I pray it won't fade away
I can see your halo
You hit me like a ray of sun
Everywhere we lookin' now
Haiti, we can see your halo
Your halo
I can feel your halo
If it's what you truly want
I can wear her skin over mine, her hair over mine
Her hands as gloves, her teeth as confetti
Her scalp, a cap
Her sternum, my bedazzled cane
We can pose for a photograph, all three of us
Immortalized
You and your perfect girl
Ohhh
But still I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
But I saw something else I like
And I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
And you just don't feel right anymore
I? M just tired and I need a change
Sorry boy, but you got me bored, something's catching my eye
I was only satisfied for a little while
Switch him out
Kick him out
But still I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
I really thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I thought it was so sweet in the beggining
That's reason in up your times expire
Sorry boy, but you got me bored, I gotta move around
If I ain't gotta a ring by now that means I'm not tied down
But still I see something else that I like
Coming soon...
I'm a pretty girl, I'm a beauty like pearls, the prettiest girl in the world, no girl can be just like me
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?" Oh baby
Drunk in love we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in that club
We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights, boy I'm drinking
Walking in my l'assemblage
If you scared, call that reverend, boy I'm drinking
Get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out, like washrags, he wet it up , boy I'm drinking
I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway then riding with my surfboard
Grainin' on that wood, grainin', grainin' on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that
We be all night, love, love (I'm nice right now, hold up)
Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight
Catch a charge I might
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!" Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!" I'm nice!
For y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast, we goin' in
We be all night (we be all night) love, love
I been sippin', that's the only thing, that's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
I want your body right here, daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty, daddy, I want you
