Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Kind of mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you...
Anymore
Hands, hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break
I don't wanna be you
Billie
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & 
Mehki Raine
]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…
[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & 
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now
[Bridge: Billie Eilish & 
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful
It's not true
Tell me I’ve been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh
Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying
We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can’t escape the way I love you
I don’t want to, but I love you, ooh
Ooh, ooh
"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say (Aww)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha)
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
(Yay)
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn
No time to die, mmm
No time to die, ooh
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair (No fair)
When you give me those ocean eyes (Those ocean eyes)
I'm scared (I'm scared)
(Seye naeco esoht)
(Seye naeco ruoy otni 'nillaf)
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da (Hgih siht etiuq morf nellaf reven ev'I)
(Deracs m'I) Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da (Seye naeco esoht em evig uoy nehw)
Mmm (Yrc em ekam ot woh wonk yllaer uoy)
Mmm (Riaf on)
Mind
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
Where's my mind?
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Mind)
Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless
I lost my mind
I don't mind
(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache
Bellyache, bellyache)
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
Your silence is my favorite sound
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)
You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty
Crown
You should see me in a crown (You should see me, see me)
Your silence is my favorite sound (You should see me, see me)
I can't seem to focus
And you don't seem to notice I'm not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
To find your reflection's all alone
I had to go
Can't you hear me?
I'm not comin' home
Do you understand?
I've changed my plans
'Cause I, I'm in love
With my future
Can't wait to meet her
And I (I), I'm in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself
I know supposedly I'm lonely now (Lonely now)
Know I'm supposed to be unhappy
Without someone (Someone)
But aren't I someone? (Aren't I someone? Yeah)
I'd (I'd) like to be your answer (Be your answer)
'Cause you're so handsome (You're so handsome)
But I know better
Than to drive you home
'Cause you'd invite me in
And I'd be yours again
But I (I), I'm in love (Love, love, love, love)
With my future
And you don't know her (Ooh)
And I, I'm in love (Love, love)
But not with anybody here
I'll see you in a couple years
My Lucifer is lonely
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow
All the good girls go to Hell (All the good girls go to Hell)
'Cause even God herself (God herself) has enemies
And once the water starts to rise (Water starts to rise)
There's nothing left to save now
My god is gonna owe me
Haha!
I cannot do the snowflake
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever
Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god
(
And it's like, wait, like, when?
)
Wakin' up at sundown (Ooh)
They're late to every party (Ooh)
Nobody's ever sorry (Ooh)
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down (Come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (Hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (Learning)
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance
Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake
They just keep doin' nothing
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Come down
Hurting
Learning
Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone
Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych
Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you stay inside?
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life
Hurry, I'm worried
The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you're gonna die, not by mistake
So, where did you go?
So tell me you'll come home
Even if it's just a lie
I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to
Was hoping you'd come home
I don't care if it's a lie
Take me to the rooftop
I wanna see the world when I stop breathing
Turnin' blue
Tell me love is endless, don't be so pretentious
Leave me like you do (Like you do)
If you need me, wanna see me
Better hurry 'cause I'm leavin' soon
Sorry can't save me now
Sorry I don't know how
Sorry there's no way out (Sorry)
But down
Hmm, down
Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That's what a year-long headache does to you
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered
Don't say I'm all that matters
Leave me, déjà vu (Hmm)
You better hurry, I'm leavin' soon
Sorry can't save me now (Sorry)
Sorry I don't know how (Sorry)
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
But I'm not sorry
Sorry
No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There’s a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin’ to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction
I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life
Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever ’cause I don’t self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it (Teh)
I'm the powder, you’re the fuse
Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my— asking about my motto
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right?
Did you like it? Did you like that?
Um, which part?
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
Now you know
Now I'm free
Watch my heart burn
Never let you back
Let you back, let you back
Never gonna let you back
Let you back
I wanna be alone
Alone with you, does that make sense?
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right, so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right, so stay a sec
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Like a hostage
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
But nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone
Hold you
(Three and four and)
Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da-ba-da
Mmm, mmm
My boy's bein' sus, he was shady enough
But now he's just a shadow
My boy loves his friends like I love my split ends
And by that, I mean he cuts 'em off
What?
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
My boy's bein' sus and he don't know how to cuss
He just sounds like he's tryna be his father (
Who are you?
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar
And by that, I mean he said he'd change
My boy, my-my boy, my friends
I love-love, I-I love-love my split ends
My boy (Love, love, love, love, love, love)
My-my boy (Love, love, love, love, love, love)
My boy, my (Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
(Alright, dude, go trip over a knife)
You want me to be yours? Well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back
It won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?
Could roses bloom?
They're playin' our sound
Layin' us down tonight
And all of these clouds
Crying us back to life
But you're cold as a knife
Six feet under
Bloom
Again
Hmm-mm
Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet
Hmm-mm, quiet
You see the piece of paper
Could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
And you don't have to keep it quiet
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play
Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence
Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
Too shy to say but I hope you stay
Wait a minute, let me finish
I know you don't care
But can you listen?
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain
Around my neck, but now it's missin', hmm
Da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm)
Oh, hmm, hmm
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
You said, "Don't treat me badly"
But you said it so sadly
So I did the best I could
Not thinkin' you would have left me gladly
I know you're not sorry
Why should you be?
'Cause who am I to be in love
When your love never is for me?
Me
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm)
You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there
Well, what a shame, I'm not there
What is it you want?
You can lie, but I know that you're not fine
Every time you talk
It's all 'bout me, but you swear I'm not on your mind
Everybody knows
You and I are suicide and stolen art (Art)
Pretty mama sews
Stitches into all your bitches broken hearts
Somebody new is gonna comfort you
Like you want me to
Somebody new is gonna comfort me
Like you never do
Every now and then, it hits me
That I'm the one that got away
But I guess being lonely fits me
And you were made for begging, "stay"
Hey, leave a message
Hey, call me back when ya get this
Or when you've got a minute
We really need to talk
Wait, you know what?
Maybe just forget it
'Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked
"Stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday, by the way
"It's not you, it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Don'tcha, babe?
I'm not your party favor
Look, now I know we coulda done it better
But we can't change the weather
When the weather's come and gone
Books don't make sense if you read 'em backwards
You'll single out the wrong words
Like you mishear all my songs
You'll hear "stay" and "blah blah blah"
Happy birthday by the way
Our time is up
Your eyes are shut
I won't get to tell you what
I needed you to know
It's dark enough
The moonlight doesn't show
And all my love
Could never bring you home
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're all that's on my mind
I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more than you could know
I sat alone
Awaited your reply
Was driven home
When I started to cry
I should've known
I should've said goodbye
I only hoped
I would've had more time
You're always on my mind
When I called a thousand times
But I love you more and more than you could know-oh
Oh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-ra-da
We're both too young
To live and die this way
A sunny summer day
With so much left to say
Not 21
The 18th out of pain
The day you couldn't stay
You made me wanna pray
But I think God's fake
But I love you more and more and more and more and more
More and more, more and more and more than you will ever know
You will never know
Please, please
Don't leave﻿ me
Be
What do you want from me?
Don't ask questions
Wait a minute
Baby, I don't feel so good
And all the good girls go ﻿to Hell
Aah
The games you played were never fun
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you say I need, say I need
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need? (I need)
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored
I'm home alone, you're God-knows-where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair
Giving you all you want and more
Giving you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm getting bored?
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me
What makes you sure you're all I need?
And when you walk out the door and leave me torn
When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea
But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler than it should ever be
Hmm
I'm on my back again
Dreaming of a time and place
Where you and I remain the best of friends
Even after all this ends
Can we pretend?
I'm on my, I'm on my back again
It's seeming more and more
Like all we ever do is see how far it bends
Before it breaks in half and then
We bend it back again
Guess I got caught in the middle of it
Yes I've been taught, got a little of it
In my blood, in my blood
Memories burn like a forest fire
Heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud
In the flood
I'm watching movies back to back in black and white, I never
Seen anybody do it like I do it any better
Been goin' over you, I'm overdue for new endeavors
Nobody lonely like I'm lonely and I don't know whether
You'd really like it in the limelight
You'd sympathize with all the bad guys
I'm still a victim in my own right
But I'm the villain in my own eyes, yeah
Breathe the air again, it's a beautiful day
I wish this moment would stay with the Earth
Some primal paradise
But there you go again, saying everything ends
Saying you can't depend on anything, or anyone
If the end of the world was near
Where would you choose to be?
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide
Or run for your life
Or stand here and spend it with me
If we had five more minutes
Would I, could I, make you happy?
And we would live again
In the simplest of ways
Living day after day
Like some primal animals
We would love again
Under glorious suns
With the freedom that comes with the truth
Would you panic and hide?
Or run for your life?
Or stand here and spend it with me?
So it finally came to pass
I saw the end of the world
Saw the madness unfold like
Some primal burial
And I looked back upon
Armageddon
And the moment of truth
Between you and me
If we had five more minutes of air to breathe
And we cried all through it
But you spent them with me
On our last few drags of air we agree
I was and you were happy
[Spoken: Billie Eilish & 
FINNEAS
My Invisalign has finally...
I have taken out my Invisalign
I have taken out my Invisalign, and this is the album
Hahahahahahahahahahaha, ahh
In the end, when they're all gone
When the world is silent and the days are long
Just you and I, we'll be alive
We made it on our own
'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody wants to think they won't
And everybody seems to think they won't, they won't, they won't, they won't
Maybe I'm still alive but my heart is beating slow
Baby, tell me I gotta know
Are you okay? You seem too far gone
Infected, standing there all alone
And everybody makes it 'till they don't
The best of me, the best of me is you
The best of me, the best of me was you
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ladum, badum, mmmm
Another story of girl meets boy, and gets destroyed, uh, oh
Another promise broken in two, the lucky view of fiction
Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story of girl meets boy
He's okay, she's broken
He's the ocean waves, she's chokin'
So picture perfect, it can't be real and all you feel is numb
You see them talking but hear no sound to hit the ground
And fade
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't need it, don't, don't need it
I'm not crying on the phone when you call
What's the use in begging you to stay?
I'm not trying to save us anymore
Cut me loose, 'cause you're too far away
To make me feel better, make it alright
To give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo, push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo
, seven days in limbo
Seven days
I'll give all my weapons to you
We've said it all, no more bones to break
I'm done thinking that we might just spark enough
We're broken glass waiting to be washed away
Can't make me feel better, make it alright
Give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
If you love me, let me go
If you love me, leave limbo
Can't give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo, just push me out the window
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
'Cause ever since I left the city
(Late night when you need my love)
(Call me on my cell phone)
(I know when that hotline bling)
(That could only mean one thing)
I know you don't care, but can you listen?
Wore my heart out on a chain around my neck
And now it's missing
You're looking at me like I'm see-through
But you said it so sadly, so I did the best I could
Not thinking you would have left me gladly
I know you're not sorry, why should you be?
'Cause who am I to be in love when your love is never for me?
You're saying that you miss me, oh well
Never even got a kiss without a countdown
It's time to face the facts
You treat me like a snack
Only text back when you're hungry
Your love's so insecure
You're never really sure
Boy, you never listen
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby
You're saying that you're sorry, so what?
You ask me what I want, for you to shut up
It's time to come to terms
Put myself first
When your bubble bursts got soap in your eye
Telling you it's wrong to break into my songs
Boy, you gotta listen
So take this as my last goodbye
And play it when you're lonely
Don't you say I didn't try to reach
Your hand to hold me
I just wanna walk the line
Press record and hit rewind
I've made up my mind to erase you
Oh, to erase you
Oh, oh
Do you know me?
Really know me?
You have opinions
About my opinions
About my music
About my clothes
About my body
Some people hate what I wear
Some people praise it
Some people use it to shame others
Some people use it to shame me
But I feel you watching
Always
And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares
Your disapproval
Or your sigh of relief
If I lived by them
I'd never be able to move
Would you like me to be smaller?
Weaker?
Softer?
Taller?
Would you like me to be quiet?
Do my shoulders provoke you?
Does my chest?
Am I my stomach?
My hips?
The body I was born with
Is it not what you wanted?
If I wear what is comfortable
I am not a woman
If I shed the layers
I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body
You still judge it
And judge me for it
Why?
We make assumptions about people
Based on their size
We decide who they are
We decide what they're worth
If I wear more
If I wear less
Who will decide what that makes me?
What that means?
Is my value based only on your perception?
Or is your opinion of me?
Not my responsibility
Lights out
You're not here holding me
I count
Every tear down my cheek
Instead of sheep
Sleep walk
Find myself on your street
Three knocks
Ring the bell then I leave
I tried to live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true
Cold days
Frozen lake in the park
Old ways
Make mistakes when I'm lost
Now we've got it all
Bad dreams
Might not mean anything
But you seem
Not to need anything
I'm still so blue
True blue, true blue, hey
True blue
And I'm still so blue
Your butt is mine, I'm gonna tell you right
Just show your face in broad daylight
I'm telling you on how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
I'm giving you on count of three
To show your stuff or let it be
'Cause I'm telling you just watch your mouth
I know your game what you're about
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
So just wait till I get through
Because I'm bad, I'm bad, c'mon
You know I'm big, I'm bad, you know
You know I'm big, I'm bad, I'm really really bad
And the whole world's got has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad?
The word is out, you're doing wrong
Gonna lock you up before too long
Your lying eyes gonna tell you right
So listen up, don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man
You're throwing stones to hide your hands
Because I'm big, I'm bad, c'mon
And the whole world's got to answer right now
I want you
I swear I'd stop breathing
If it would benefit you
If that’s all I had to do, mm
I'll give up everything
Because I'm in love with you
Yes, I’m in love with you
If that's all I had to do
I've got a man that doesn't love me
He's got a girl that doesn't love him
She's got a brother down in county
He's got a tattoo for his cousin
Another house on fire by Venice beach
She's got a man she doesn't love who doesn't  love me
Another house on fire by Venice Beach
She's got a man she doesn't love who doesn't love me
I don't need to know
Who you can't let go
Cry 'bout so and so
(She's got a man, got a man, doesn't love me)
Hoy desperté con ganas de besarte
Tengo una sed de acariciarte
Enredarme a ti y no soltarte
Eres tan embriagante
Eres tú
Quiero contemplarte sin contar el tiempo
Dibujarte con mis puros recuer'os
En mi mente marcarme tus labios, tus besos
Estar aquí otro momento
Wait time is the worst
I can hardly sit
No one has the time
Someone's always late
I look for you
And you look for me
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground
Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is telling
You something that you would not like me to tell you
Wait time is to blame
Mat top frame's a trip
We all have the time
Someone's always fed
I look for you, and you look away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Waking up is so much fun to do
(Tell me, don't tell me, the hard part is telling me something that you would not like me to tell you)
'80 movie make out party with you
I don't know
I just wish I wasn't breathing
If I wasn't breathing
Would that change your mind?
You make me sad, boy
Well look who’s sad, daddy
Givenchy on your kisses (I would)
Wanna lay down with your misses
(Oh yeah)
Wanna hear your heartbeat (listen up)
When we're apart we
Walking up the hill tonight
When you have closed your eyes
I wish I didn't have to make
All those mistakes and be wise
Please try to be patient
And know that I'm still learning
I'm sorry that you have to see
The strength inside me burning
But where are you my angel now?
Don't you see me crying?
I know that you can't do it all
But you can't say I'm not trying
But please try to be patient
Somebody said you got a new friend
Does she love you better than l can?
There's a big black sky over my town
I know where you're at, l bet she's around
Yeah, I know it's stupid
I just gotta see it for myself
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home, oh
I keep dancing on my own
I've given my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home, oh
And this is how it starts
You take your shoes off in the back of my van
Yeah my shirt looks so good
When it's just hanging off your back
And she said use your hands and my spare time
We’ve got one thing in common, it's this tongue of mine
She's got a boyfriend anyway
There’s only minutes before I drop you off
All we seem to do is talk about sex
I loved your friend when I saw his film
He's got a funny face, but I like that cause he still looks cool
Now we're on the bed in my room
And I'm about to fill his shoes
But you say no
You say no
Does he take care of you?
Or could I easily fill his shoes?
Now we’re just outside of town
And you’re making your way down
She’s got a boyfriend anyway
And I'm not trying to stop you, love
If we're gonna do anything we might as well just fuck
You've got your tongue pierced anyway
You in your high tops any day
You in your skinny jeans anyway
You and your fit friends anyway
I'd take them all out any day
They've all got back combs anyway
You all got boyfriends anyway
[Verse 1: Billie Eilish, 
Billie Eilish & FINNEAS
I don't like stayin' at home
When the moon is bleeding red
Woke up stoned in the backseat
From a dream where my teeth fell out of my head
Cut it up, cut it up, yeah
Everybody's on something here
My godsend chemical best friend
Skeleton whispering in my ear
Walk with me to the end
Stare with me into the abyss
Do you feel like letting go?
I wonder how far down it is
[Chorus: Billie Eilish, 
Nothing is fun
Not like before
You don't get me high anymore
It used to take one
Now it takes four
[Verse 2, Billie Eilish, 
Runnin' through emergency rooms
Spinning wheels and ceiling fans
My handshake, cellophane, landscape
Mannequin fakin' it the best that I can
Cadillac, Cadillac red
No hands on the steering wheel
I'm crashing this save-a-ho puppet show
UFO obliterate the way I feel
[Chorus: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS, 
Billie Eilish
But nothing is fun
Use me, 'cause everyone else is
What's the difference?
When you're lookin' at my lips
And not being legally allowed to kiss them
Baby, don't I look good?
Just waiting for you to call me
Baby, yeah I'm up to no good
I'll do you what you ask me
If you let me be free
If you want me, satisfy me
I'm underneath
Looking out, just out of reach
But it makes me slur my speech
Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin
If I can’t help falling in love with you?
-(Oh, here's when it gets hard)
Like a- wait
Like a river flows
-(I'm just gonna not play it)
Surely to the sea
My darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can’t help falling in love with you
I don't really want to drive
But I think I'd rather die
In Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends
On Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot
Foot on the gas
I'm just tryna pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
None
Strange
Boy, you're acting shady
Hey - call me back when ya get this
Or when you've a minute
Wait - you know what
Cause by the time you get this
"Stay" and "bla bla bla"
Happy birthday by the way...
"It's not you it's me" and all that other bullshit
Dontcha, babe
Look - now I know we coulda done it better
Books don't make sense if ya read 'em backwards
You hear "stay" and "bla bla bla"
You were from the North, I was from the South
We were from opposite places, different towns
But I knew it was good and you knew it was too
So we moved together like a ball and chain
Minds becoming two halves of the same
It was real, and the shadows grew
Cause you've got a secret don't ya babe?
I would've shouted loud and broken through
I would've given it all to belong to you
But there were different plans, different rules
You said "where I'm from there is a lock and key
If you'd be so kind as to follow me
I will show you the way to the rest of my sins"
Yeah you, you got a secret don't ya babe?
And I should know
Yeah I should know
Yeah you, you've got a secret don't ya babe?
For I'm your secret aren't I babe?
Yeah I'm your secret aren't I babe?
Aren't I babe?
Can you guess
What I'm thinking of?
Let's take a ride downtown
If I can't wake up
Would you still... something else
If I can't return your corpse
No, I'm still involved
If I can't 
If I sit on the floor, on the floor
Can't you see?
He hurt her
How do you breathe
Without me?
How do you see me?
          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
        
So I just wanted to say something real quick, which is yesterday I was at Kimmel, which was amazing, and when I left I had to go to a rehearsal. So to walk to the car, there was an alley that I walked through. Like 500 feet to my left was a group of fans, and then like 500 feet to my right was what I thought was fans and paparazzi.
I started, I went to the left side. I walked all the way over to them and hugged them all, I took pictures and talked to them for a second. Didn't sign anything, because I like don't do that. That's something I don't do, because I used to and I realised all anyone did was sell everything that I signed so I stopped doing that. It's kind of a policy of mine that I don't.
So I talked to them, hugged them all, I went to the other side and as I got closer, like they were cheering for me and stuff, and shouting for my name and stuff, and so I walked.
And as I got closer, I kind of realised that it was pretty much all paparazzi and ebayers, which is what we call people that just take my signature and sell it and couldn't give less of a fuck about me at all.
But I didn't want to like be disrespectful at all, so I went up to them all and I like tried to get like hugs and try to touch all of their hands like do that down the line or whatever, and I started to do that. Nobody put their hands out. Nobody tried to hug me back...I hugged one girl at the end, and so she was really sweet...
But then I tried to walk like a couple feet across from where they were, not where the first group was, but like in the same area that I was in, because I thought that's where there were fans.
When I looked over there, they were gone. And I was like, OK well, I guess nobody here really wants anything from me besides a fucking autograph, which I don't do because these bitches will sell that shit.
Like, I'll sign something if it's like for a special occasion or if somebody's in need or whatever, of course I'm gonna do that. But I have this whole thing about not signing things because I just want to be there. I'd way rather get a hug and talk to you than take a picture with you and fucking sign something so you can sell that shit.
I don't do that, and I've tried to make that clear like a billion times,  and I said it before I went over to them.
Anyway.
I started to walk away, because I realised none of these people actually cared about anything that had to do with me as a person. Um, and so I walked away.
As I started to walk away back to the car, they all started to boo me.
And then they all started calling me a little bitch, and saying I'm gonna lose my Grammy nominations, and you know, what a little fucking you know, whatever, just cursing me out and shit.
Damn, dude, like...
Then I started hearing them comparing, they kept being like, "Lorde would have stopped". I'm like, I did stop! I walked 500 fe- I walked like 1,000 feet to come say hi to you and give some hugs and y'all are booing me and calling me a little bitch?
Like, the fact that people can switch up like that ...damn. Like wait outside for you, and then immediately they don't get what they want, and they boo you and fucking curse at you.
I'm like, "Bro, I'm 17! You're ..." Oh my God, this shit is...! I turned around ready to fucking pounce, and then I got told to just ignore it and not give a reaction, which is probably good, and it's probably stupid dumb of me making these videos but...
Mm...anyway, the only reason I'm making this video is because I saw a video of this all happening and I just wanted to clarify what actually happened. Because if you watch the video it literally looks like I'm watching by a bunch of fans and like completely ignoring them and not saying hi to them, which is not at all what happened.
I literally walked from the other side of the alley, which was like 1,000 feet. Which is fine, I'm like happy to do it. But I walked over there literally only to say hi, only to hug people. I literally went over and I was like, "I don't want pictures, I want to hug", and I got pictures of me shoved into my fucking face. And no love whatsoever.
So I left and then I got booed and got called a little bitch and got told that I'm gonna lose my Grammys.
I probably am gonna lose the Grammys, but it's okay though! I'm not worried about that, it's the nomination that counts!
Anyway! I don't know, I just wanted to, I don't even know...I went back to the other side where the real fans were and I was like, "Guys they booed me!" And they were very sweet. You guys are my friends, I love you a lot.
And to the grown men that booed me and called me a little bitch, I hope the best for you. I hope you can find someone else you can use to make money off of and belittle. So yeah, all the best!
Love you paparazzi.

I fear no man
I move swiftly
Thru the night
I shed light
If I can't wake up
Would you still
If I can't
Return your calls
Know I'm still involved
On for
Can't forget you see
How does
How do you
Breathe
Without me
Without
Do you see me
No time left to die
Do you wanna dance with your little girl?
In the shadows I can see those things you hid
From me
You burn all your dirty laundry
You curse at your phone
