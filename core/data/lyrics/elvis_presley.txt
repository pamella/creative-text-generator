Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay? Would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you
The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumping and the joint began to swing
You shoulda heard those knocked out jailbirds sing
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joey blowing on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang
Number forty-seven said to number three
"You the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"
Rock, rock, rock
Sad sack was sitting on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weeping all alone
The warden said, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
You can't find a partner, use a wooden chair"
Shifty Henry said to Bugs, "For Heaven's sake
No one's looking, now's our chance to make a break"
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks."
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Love me tender, love me sweet
Never let me go
You have made my life complete
And I love you so
Love me tender, love me true
All my dreams fulfilled
For my darling I love you
And I always will
Love me tender, love me long
Take me to your heart
For it's there that I belong
And we'll never part
Love me tender, love me dear
Tell me you are mine
I'll be yours through all the years
Till the end of time
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
When they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
Yeah, they said you was high classed
Yeah, you ain't never caught a rabbit
Ahh, ahh
You know, they said you was high classed
You ain't no friend of mine
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (with suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds
So, if an old friend I know
Stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see the tears are real, I'm crying
(Yes, I'm crying)
Oh, let our love survive
I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
When, honey, you know I've never lied to you
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap?
Because I love you too much, baby...
Well, since my baby left me
Well, I found a new place to dwell
Well, it's down at the end of lonely street
At Heartbreak Hotel
You make me so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I get so lonely I could die
Although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry away their gloom
And be so
Now the bellhop's tears keep flowing
The desk clerk's dressed in black
Well they've been so long on lonely street
They'll never look back
Well now, if your baby leaves you
And you got a tale to tell
Just take a walk down lonely street
To Heartbreak Hotel
Are you lonesome tonight?
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray
To a bright sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?
Spoken:
I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each of us must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two, you seemed to changed, you acted strange
And why I've never know
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down
Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch, a long lonely time
And time goes by, so slowly and time can do so much
Are you, still mine?
I need your love, I need your love
Godspeed your love to me
Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers cry, wait for me, wait for me
To the open arms, wait for me
My love, my darling, I've hungered for your kiss
Are you still mine?
Godspeed your love, to me
As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago morning
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another little hungry mouth to feed
People, don't you understand
A child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way
Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, He steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
And as her young man dies
Another little baby child is born
Well, it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, now go, cat, go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes
Well, you can knock me down, step in my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you wanna do
But uh-uh honey, lay off of them shoes
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Let's go, cat!
Ah, walk the dog
You can burn my house, 
steal my car
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
Do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh, honey, lay off of my shoes
Well, you can do anything, but lay off of my blue suede shoes
Rock it
Yeah!
Three to get ready, now go, go, go
Well, you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes
Well it's blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, yeah
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, baby
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Baby, if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please, let's forget the past
The future looks bright ahead
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of
Don't stop thinking of me
Don't make me feel this way
C'mon over here and love me
You know what I want you to say
Why should we be apart?
I really love you, baby, cross my heart
Let's walk up to the preacher
And let us say "I do"
Then you'll know you'll have me
And I'll know that I'll have you
I can't stop loving you
I said  I've made up my mind, yes I did
To live in memory
Of such an lone-, lonely time
And I can't stop wanting you
I said It's useless to say, yes I did
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours
All that we once knew
Though long ago
They still make me blue
They say that time
It heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart
So I've made up my mind, yes I did
I said it's useless to say, yes I did
Lord Almighty
I feel my temperature rising
Higher higher
It's burning through to my soul
Girl, girl, girl, girl
You're gonna set me on fire
My brain is flaming
I don't know which way to go
Your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Help me, I'm flaming
I must be a hundred and nine
Burning, burning, burning
And nothing can cool me
I just might turn into smoke
But I feel fine
'Cause your kisses lift me higher
And you light my morning sky
It's coming closer
The flames are now licking my body
Won't you help me
I feel like I'm slipping away
It's hard to breathe
And my chest is a-heaving
Lord, have mercy
I'm burning a hole where I lay
Like the sweet song of a choir
(Ah, ah, burning love)
I'm just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
(Ahh, ahh)
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me
(Ooh)
And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue memories start callin'
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
(Ooh, ah ooh)
You can shake an apple off an apple tree
Shake-a, shake-a sugar, but you'll never shake me
Uh-uh-uh
No-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm going to stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you
I'm going to run my fingers thru your long black hair
Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
'Cause once I catch you and the kissing starts
A team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart
Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is going to keep us tied
Oh yeah, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
I'm gonna stick like glue, yeah yeah
Because I'm stuck on you
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
(You were always on my mind)
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
If I make you feel second best
Girl, I'm so sorry I was blind
Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied, satisfied
And I guess I never told you...
You look like an angel
Walk like an angel
Talk like an angel
But I got wise
You're the devil in disguise
Oh yes you are
The devil in disguise
You fooled me with your kisses
You cheated and you schemed
Heaven knows how you lied to me
You're not the way you seemed
I thought that I was in heaven
But I was sure surprised
Heaven help me, I didn't see
The devil in your eyes
And now the end is near
So I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
Oh, and more, much more than this
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, no not me
For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has not
To say the words he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
Uh, well, a-bless my soul
What's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm ooh, yeah, yeah
Well, my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?
Well, please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I feel fine
When I'm near the girl that I love best
My heart beats so it scares me to death
When she touched my hand, what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
My tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this body of mine
That's to have that girl that I love so fine
She touched my hand, what a chill I got
Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland
Oh I wish I was in Dixie, away, away
In Dixieland I take my stand to live and die in Dixie
Because Dixieland, that's where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Glory, glory hallelujah
His truth is marching on
So hush little baby
Don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
But all my trials, Lord will soon be over
There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land
Where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true, oh why
There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong winds of promise that will blow away
The doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear
We're lost in a cloud
With too much rain
We're trapped in a world
That's troubled with pain
But as long as a man
Has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly
Deep in my heart there's a trembling question
Still I am sure that the answers
Answers gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark
There's a beckoning candle, yeah
And while I can think, while I can talk
While I can stand, while I can walk
While I can dream
Oh please let my dream
Come true
Right now
Let it come true right now
Oh yeah
Treat me like a fool
Treat me mean and cruel
But love me
Wring my faithful heart
Tear it all apart
But love me (won't you love me)
Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh, so lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you, dear only
I would beg and steal (beg and steal)
Just to feel (just to feel)
Your heart (I want your heart)
Beating close to mine (so close to mine)
I would beg and steal (he would beg and steal)
Just to feel (yes, just to feel)
Beggin' on my knees
All I ask is please, please love me
A little less conversation, a little more action please
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby
Baby close your eyes and listen to the music
Drifting through a summer breeze
It's a groovy night and I can show you how to use it
Come along with me and put your mind at ease
Shut your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Come on baby I'm tired of talking
Grab your coat and let's start walking
Come on, come on
Don't procrastinate, don't articulate
Girl it's getting late, gettin' upset waitin' around
Satisfy me
It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
My love won't wait
When I first saw you
With your smile so tender
My heart was captured
My soul surrendered
I'd spend a lifetime
Waiting for the right time
Now that you're near
The time is here at last
Just like a willow
We would cry an ocean
If we lost true love
And sweet devotion
Your lips excite me
Let your arms invite me
For who knows when
We'll meet again this way
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Then say it's very nice
And then you run
Do what your big sister done
Well, I dated your big sister
And I took her to a show
I went for some candy
Along came Jim Dandy
And they snuck right out of the door
Every time I see your sister
Well she's got somebody new
She's mean and she's evil
Like that little old boll weevil
Guess I'll try my luck with you
Well, I used to pull your pigtails
And pinch your turned-up nose
But you been a growing
And baby, it's been showing
From your head down to your toes
Don't, don't, that's what you say
Each time that I hold you this way
When I feel like this and I want to kiss you
Baby, don't say don't
Don't don't
Don't, don't leave my embrace
For here in my arms is your place
When the night grows cold and I want to hold you
Don't don't don't
If you think that this is just a game
I'm playing
If you think that I don't mean
Every word I'm saying
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't feel that way
I'm your love and yours I will stay
This you can believe
I will never leave you
Heaven knows I won't
Don't please don't
Return to sender!
I gave a letter to the postman
He put it his sack
Bright in early next morning
He brought my letter back
(She wrote upon it)
Return to sender
Address unknown
No such number
No such zone
We had a quarrel
A lover's spat
I write I'm sorry, but my letter keeps coming back
So then I dropped it in the mailbox
And sent it special D
It came right back to me
No such person
This time I'm gonna take it myself
And put it right in her hand
And if it comes back the very next day
Then I'll understand
(The writing on it)
Well, that's all right, mama
That's all right for you
That's all right mama, just anyway you do
Well, that's all right, that's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you do
Mama, she told me
Papa done told me too
Son, that girl you're fooling with
She ain't no good for you
But, that's all right, that's all right
I'm leaving town, baby
I'm leaving town for sure
Well, then you won't be bothered with
Me hanging around your door
Daddadeedeedeedee, deedeedeedeedee, deedeedeedeedee
Need your lovin'
That's all right
Can't you see
I love you
Please don't break my heart in two
That's not hard to do
Cause I don't have a wooden heart
And if you say goodbye
Then I know that I would cry
Maybe I would die
There's no strings upon this love of mine
It was always you from the start
Treat me nice
Treat me good
Treat me like you really should
Cause I'm not made of wood
And I don't have a wooden heart
Muss i denn, muss i denn
Zum Stadtele hinaus
Stadtele hinaus
Und du, mein Schatz, bleibst hier?
Sei mir gut
Sei mir wie du wirklich sollst
Wie du wirklich sollst
If you're looking for trouble
You came to the right place
Just look right in my face
I was born standing up
And talking back
My daddy was a green-eyed mountain jack
Because I'm evil
My middle name is misery
Well I'm evil
So don't you mess around with me
I've never looked for trouble
But I've never ran
I don't take no orders
From no kind of man
I'm only made out
Of flesh, blood and bone
But if you're gonna start a rumble
Don't you try it on alone
I'm evil, evil, evil as can be
So don't mess around don't mess around don't mess around with me
I'm evil, I'm evil
Evil, evil
So don't mess around, don't mess around with me
I'm evil, I tell you I'm evil
So don't mess around with me
Yeah
Never know how much I love you
Never knew how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said '
Julie, baby, you're my flame
Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm on fire
Fever, yeah, I burn forsooth
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said 'Daddy-o, don't you dare
He give me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right'
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give you fever when we kiss you
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
When no one else can understand me
When everything I do is wrong
You give me hope and consolation
You give me strength to carry on
And you're always there to lend a hand
In everything I do
That's the wonder
The wonder of you
And when you smile the world is brighter
You touch my hand and I'm a king
Your kiss to me is worth a fortune
Your love for me is everything
I'll guess I'll never know the reason why
You love me as you do
Bright light city going to set my soul
Going to set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher
There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
And they're all living the devil may care
And I'm just the devil with love to spare
Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas
How I wish that there were more
Than the twenty-four hours in the day
Even if there were forty more
I wouldn't sleep a minute away
Oh, there's black jack and poker and the roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost on every deal
All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel
Viva Las Vegas with you neon flashing
And your one arm bandits crashing
All those hopes down the drain
Viva Las Vegas turning day into nighttime
Turning night into daytime
If you see it once
You'll never be the same again
I'm going to keep on the run
I'm going to have me some fun
If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke oh well
I'll always remember that I had a swinging time
I'm gonna give it everything I've got
Lady luck please let the dice stay hot
Let me shoot a seven with every shot
Viva Las Vegas
Viva, Viva Las Vegas
When I said, I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed, but you
And now you've gone away
But don't you know that now you're gone
And I'm left here on my own
Now I have to follow you
And beg you to come home
You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, believe me
That you don't have to love me
But believe me, I'll never tie you down
Left alone just a memory
Life seems dead and so unreal
All that's left is loneliness
There's nothing left to feel
Believe me, oh believe me
Oh, you don't have to say you love me
Believe me, believe me, oh believe me
I will spend my whole life through
Loving you, just loving you
Winter, summer, springtime, too
Loving you, loving you
Makes no difference where I go or what I do
You know that I'll always be loving you
Just you and
If I'm seen with someone new
Don't be blue, don't you be blue
I'll be faithful, I'll be true
Always true, true to you
There is only one for me and you know who
I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses
And he walks with me
And he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
He speaks and the sound of his voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that he gave to me
Within my heart is ringing
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married, we'll so no man
You can do the job when you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
I said
Why me Lord? What have I ever done
To deserve even one of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord what did I ever do to deserve loving You?
And the kindness, You've shown
Lord Heavenly Jesus, I'm wasted and
So help me Jesus, I know what I am
Now that I know that I needed You so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in Your hands
Try me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can ever repay, all I've taken from You
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to You
Lord Heavenly Jesus, I praise Him
So help me Jesus, I know what I am, oh yes
Jesus, my soul's in Your hands
You saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now I am happy with the Lord
Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day
I've searched and I've searched
But I couldn't find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind
Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
We gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord
You'll searched and you'll searched
But you couldn't find
Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find the way
Blue moon, blue moon, blue moon
Keep shining bright
Blue moon, keep on shining bright
You're gonna bring me back my baby tonight
Blue moon, keep shining bright
I said blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well, it was on one moonlight night
Stars shining bright
Wish blown high
Love said goodbye
Blue moon of Kentucky
Well, I said blue moon of Kentucky
Just keep on shining
Well, a hard headed woman
A soft hearted man
Been the cause of trouble
Ever since the world began
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
A hard headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man
Now Adam told to Eve
"Listen here to me
Don't you let me catch you
Messing round that apple tree"
Samson told Delilah
Loud and clear
"Keep your cotton picking fingers
Out my curly hair"
I heard about a king
Who was doin' swell
Till he started playing
With that evil Jezebel
I got a woman
A head like a rock
If she ever went away
I'd cry around the clock
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Well, that long black train got my baby and gone
Train train, coming 'round, 'round the bend
Train train, coming 'round the bend
Well, it took my baby, but it never will again
No, not again
Train train, coming down the line
Well, it's bringing my baby, because she's mine all, all mine
She's mine, all, all mine
(Ooh, whoa)
Baby, let me be your loving teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be (oh, let him be)
Your teddy bear
I don't wanna to be a tiger
Because tigers play too rough
I don't wanna be a lion
'Cause lions ain't the kind you love enough
Just wanna be your teddy bear
Baby, let me be around you every night
Run your fingers through my hair
And cuddle me real tight
I just wanna be your teddy bear (whoo)
Hold me close, hold me tight
Make me thrill with delight
Let me know where I stand from the start
I want you, I need you, I love you
With all my heart
Every time that you're near
All my cares disappear
Darling, you're all that I'm living for
More and more
I thought I could live without romance
Until you came to me
But now I know that I will go on
Loving you eternally
Won't you please be my own?
Never leave me alone
'Cause I die every time we're apart
Well, I thought I could live without romance
But now I know that I will go
On loving you eternally
I've been travelling over mountains
Even through the valleys too
I've been travelling night and day
I've been running all the way
Baby, trying to get to you
Ever since I read your letter
Where you said you loved me true
When I read your loving letter
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us
But they didn't mean a thing
I just had to reach you, baby
In spite of all that I've been through
I kept travelling night and day
I kept running all the way
Well if I had to do it over
That's exactly what I'd do
I would travel night and day
And I'd still run all the way
Well, there's nothing that could hold me
Or that could keep me away from you
When your loving letter told me
That you really loved me true
Lord above me knows I love you
It was He who brought me through
When my way was dark as night
He would shine His brightest light
When I was trying to get to you
Well get out of that bed, wash your face and hands
Get out of that bed, wash your face and hands
Well get in that kitchen, 
make some noise with your pots and pans
I believe it to my soul you're the devil in nylon hose
For the harder I work the faster my money goes
Well I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
Well you won't do right to save your doggone soul
(Shake rattle and roll)
I'm like a one-eyed cat peeping in a seafood store
Well I can look at you tell you ain't a child no more
The way you wear those dresses, the sun comes shinin' through
I can't believe my eyes, all that mess belongs to you
(Shake it!)
I went over the hill, way down underneath
You make me roll my eyes, and then you make me grit my teeth
Home is where the heart is
And my heart is anywhere you are
Anywhere you are is home
I don't need a mansion on a hill
That overlooks the sea
Anywhere you're with me is home
Maybe I'm a rolling stone
Who won't amount to much
But everything that I hold dear
Is close enough to touch
For home is where the heart is
Night and you
And blue Hawaii
The night is heavenly
And you are heaven to me
Lovely you
With all this loveliness
There should be love
Come with me
While the moon is on the sea
The night is young
And so are we, so are we
Dreams come true
In blue Hawaii
And mine could all come true
This magic night of nights with you
I don't worry
Whenever skies are gray above
Got a pocketful of rainbows
Got a heart full of love
Mister Heartache
I've found a way to make him leave
Got a star up in my sleeve
Kiss me extra tender
Hold me extra tight
Cause I'm saving your sweetness
For a lonely night, aye
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
No more teardrops
Now that I've found a love so true
I got a pocketful of rainbows
Got an armful of you
No more heartaches
And an armful of you
Rainbows
Just pretend, I'm holding you
And whispering things soft and low
And think of me, how it's going to be
Just pretend I didn't go
When I walked away, I heard you say
If you need me, you know what to do
If I knew it then, I'd be back again
So just pretend I'm right there with you
And I'll come flying to you, again
All my crying is true
Oh, I will hold you and love you again
But until then, we'll just pretend
Oh, it's funny but I can't recall
The things we said or why you're crying
But now I know it was wrong to go
I belong there by your side
And, I'll come flying to you, again
I will hold you and love you again
Oh Lord my God when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds thy hands have made
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed
When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
To take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim my God how great thou art
Then sings my soul my savior God to thee
How great thou art (how great thou art)
How great thou art
When the evening shadows fall
And you're wondering who to call
For a little company
There's always me
If your great romance should end
And you're lonesome for a friend
Darling you need never be
I don't seem to mind somehow
Playing second fiddle now
Someday you'll want me, dear
And when that day is here
Within my arms you'll come to know
Other loves may come and go
But my love for you will be eternally
Look around and you will see
When we kiss my heart's on fire
Burning with a strange desire
And I know, each time I kiss you
That your heart's on fire too
So, my darling, please surrender (surrender)
All your love so warm and tender (surrender)
Let me hold you in my arms, dear
While the moon shines bright above
All the stars will tell the story
Of our love and all its glory
Let us take this night of magic
And make it a night of love
Won't you please surrender to me (surrender)
Your lips, your arms, your heart, dear (surrender)
Be mine forever
Hear that lonesome whip-poor-will
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves began to die
That means he's lost the will to live
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
The chimes of time ring out the news
Another day is through
Someone slipped and fell
Was that someone you?
You may have longed for added strength
Your courage to renew
Do not be disheartened
For I have news for you
It is no secret what God can do
What He's done for others, He'll do for you
With arms wide open, He'll pardon you
There is no night for in His light
You'll never walk alone
Always feel at home
Wherever you may go
There is no power can conquer you
While God is on your side
Take Him at His promise
Don't run away and hide
This is the moment
I've waited for
I can hear my heart singing
Soon bells will be ringing
Ring Ring Ring
Of sweet Aloha
I will love you longer than forever
Promise me that you will leave me never
Here and now dear
All my love
I vow dear
Ua sila
Pa‘a ‘ia me ‘oe
Ko aloha makamae e ipo
Ka'u ia e lei a‘e nei la
Now that we are one
Clouds won't hide the sun
Blue skies of Hawaii smile
On this, our wedding day
I do love you with all my heart
Her hair is soft and her eyes are oh so blue
She's all the things a girl should be
But she's not you
She knows just how to make me laugh when I feel blue
She's everything a man could want
And when we're dancing
It almost feels the same
I've got to stop myself from
Whispering your name
She even kisses me like you used to do
And it's just breaking my heart
Because she's not you
I love you because you understand, dear
Every single thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand, dear
I love you most of all because you're you
No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you
No matter what may be the style or season
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
You never close your eyes
Anymore when I kiss your lips
There's no tenderness
Like before in your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it
But baby, baby I know it
You've lost that loving feeling
Whoa that loving feeling
You've lost that loving feeling, now it's gone, gone, gone
There's no tenderness in your eyes
When I reach out for you
Girl, you're starting to criticize
Every little thing that I do
It makes me just feel like crying
Oh baby, something beautiful's dying
Now it's gone, gone, gone
Baby, baby, I get down on my knees for you
If this suit weren't too tight!
If you would only love me like you used to do
We had a love, love, love, love you don't find every day
Oh don't, don't, don't, don't take it away
Listen to me, talking to you
Bring back that loving feeling
And I can't go on
Love letters straight from your heart
Keep us so near while apart
I'm not alone in the night
When I can have all the love you write
I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign
And, darling, then I read again right from the start
To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear the unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go
To write the un-writable wrong
To be better far than you are
To try when your arms are too weary
The reach the unreachable star
This is my quest, to follow that star
No matter how hopeless
No matter how far
To fight for the right
Without question or pause
To be willing to march into hell
For a heavenly cause
And I know if I'll only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart will be peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest
And the world would be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star
God bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you
Let it be me
Don't take this Heaven from one
Well if you must cling to someone
Now and forever
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love
Tell me, what would life be?
So never leave me lonely
Just tell me you love me only
And that you'll always
Tell me you love me only
Seven lonely days
And a dozen towns ago
I reached out one night and you were gone
Don't know why you'd run
What you're running to or from
All I know is I want to bring you home
So I'm walking in the rain
Thumbing for a ride
On this lonely Kentucky backroad
I've loved you much too long
My love's too strong
To let you go, never knowing what went wrong
Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town
That I'll go walking through
With the rain in my shoes (rain in my shoes)
Searching for you
In the cold Kentucky rain
Showed your photograph
To some old gray-bearded men
Sitting on a bench outside a general store
They said "Yes, she's been here"
But their memory wasn't clear
Was it yesterday, no wait, the day before
I finally got a ride
With a preacher man who asked
"Where you bound on such a cold dark afternoon?"
As we drove on thru the rain
As he listened, I explained
And he left me with a prayer that I'd find you
The cold Kentucky rain
Honey, I love you too much
I need your lovin' too much
Want the thrill of your touch
Well, gee, I can't hold you too much
You do all the livin' while I do all the givin'
'Cause I love you too much
Well, you spend all my money too much
I have to share you, honey, too much
When I want some loving', you're gone
Don't you know you're treatin' your daddy wrong
Now you got me started
Don't you leave me broken-hearted
Need your lovin' all the time
Need you huggin', please be mine
Need you near me, stay real close
Please, please hear me, you're the most
'Cause I love you too much (too much)
Every time I kiss your sweet lips
I can feel my heart go flip flip
I'm such a fool for your charms
Take me back, baby, in your arms
Like to hear you sighin'
Even though I know you're lyin'
,Cause I love you too much (too much)
I need your lovin' all the time
Don't want a four leaf clover
Don't want an old horse shoe
Want your kiss because I just can't miss
With a good luck charm like you
Come on and be my little good luck charm
Uh-huh huh, you sweet delight
I want a good luck charm
A-hanging on my arm
To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight
Don't want a silver dollar
Rabbit's foot on a string
The happiness in your warm caress
No rabbit's foot can bring
If I found a lucky penny
I'd toss it across the bay
Your love is worth all the gold on earth
No wonder that I say
I just can't help believing
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty morning
And a promise of tomorrow in her eyes
When she's lying close beside me
And my heart beats with the rhythm of her sighs
This time the girl is going to stay
For more than just a day
Oh, I just can't help believing
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
And my fingers fold around it like a glove
When she's whispering her magic
And her tears are shining honey sweet with love
When she smiles and whisper her magic
Oh, Amazing grace
, oh how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Then when, when we first begun
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
Tis Grace has brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home
Amazing grace, oh how sweet the sound
To save a wretch like me
Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose, let it fall
Lay it soft against my skin
Like the shadow on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care what's right or wrong
I won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Because tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
I don't want to be alone
It is so high
(So high, you can't get over it)
So wide
(So wide you can't get around it)
So low
(So low you can't get under it)
Great God Almighty
(You must come in at the door)
Oh it is high
(So high you can't get over it)
It is wide
You might as well..
Well I went down in the valley
You know I didn't go  there to stay
My soul got happy in the valley
You know I stayed right there all day
Well I ain't been to heaven
But I'm told
The streets the streets are pearls
You know the mighty mighty mighty gates are gold
Well it is high
I know it's so low
You might as well come in at the door
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
But when evening rolls around and it's time to go to town
Where do you go to rock and roll?
The old folks say that you got to end your date by ten
If you're out on a date and you bring it home late, it's a sin
There just ain't no excuse and you know you're going to lose and never win
I'll say it again
You pull into a drive-in, you find a place to park
You hop into the backseat where you know it's nice and dark
You're just about to groove, and you're thinking it's a breeze
Then there's a light in your eye, and then a guy says
Out of the car long hair, oowee
You're coming with me-the local police
I said, "Take it easy, baby
I worked all day and my feet feel just like lead
You got my shirt tails flying all over the place
And the sweat popping out of my head"
She said, "Hey, bossa nova baby
Keep on working for this ain't no time to quit"
She said, "Go, bossa nova baby keep on dancing
I'm about to have myself a fit"
Bossa nova, bossa nova
I said, "Hey little mama, let's sit down
Have a drink and dig the band"
She said, "Drink, drink, drink oh, fiddle-de-dink
I can dance with a drink in my hand"
She said, "Hey bossa nova baby
Keep on working for this ain't no time to drink"
She said, "Go bossa nova baby
Keep on dancing, cause I ain't got time to think"
I said, "Come on baby, it's hot in here
And it's oh so cool outside
If you lend me a dollar, I can buy some gas
And we can go for a little ride"
Keep on working for I ain't got time for that"
Keep on dancing or I'll find myself another cat"
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby baby
Baby, baby baby, b-b-b-b-b-b baby baby, baby
Baby baby baby
Come back, baby, I wanna play house with you
Well, you may go to college
You may go to school
You may have a pink Cadillac
But don't you be nobody's fool
Now baby
Come back, baby, come
Come back, baby
I wanna play house with you
Now listen and I'll tell you baby
What I'm talking about
Come on back to me, little girl
So we can play some house
Oh let's play house, baby
Now this is one thing, baby
That I want you to know
Come on back and let's play a little house
And we can act like we did before
Well, baby
Hit it
Now listen to me, baby
Try to understand
I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
Oh, baby baby baby
Baby baby baby b-b-b-b-b-b baby baby baby
Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine
Quiet thoughts come floating down
And settle softly to the ground
Like golden autumn leaves around my feet
I touched them and they burst apart with sweet memories
Sweet memories
Of holding hands and red bouquets
And twilights trimmed in purple haze
And laughing eyes and simple ways
And quiet nights and gentle days, with you
Memories, memories
And twilight trimmed in purple haze
Memories, memories, sweet memories
Memories
When I walk through that door
Baby be polite
You're gonna make me sore
If you don't greet me right
Don't you ever kiss me once, kiss me twice
I know that you've been told
It's not fair to tease
So if you come on cold
I'm really gonna freeze
If you don't want me to be cold as ice
Make me feel at home
If you really care
Scratch my back and run your pretty
Fingers through my hair
You know I'll be your slave
If you ask me to
But if you don't behave
I'll walk right out on you
If you want my love then take my advice
If you really want my love then treat me nice
One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true
Just call my name
And I'll be right by your side
I want your sweet helping hand
My love's too strong to hide
Always lived, very quiet life
I have never did no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Has been too lonely too long
Wop-bom-a-loowah, belah-bam-boom
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
I got a gal named Sue, she knows just what to do
She rock me to the east, she rock me to the west
She's the gal that I love best
I got a gal named Daisy, she almost drives me crazy
She knows how to love me, yes indeed
Boy, you don't know what she do to me
Hit it!
Well, tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Oh, mama liked the roses she grew them in the yard
But Winter always came around and made the growing way too hard
Oh, mama liked the roses and when she had the time
She'd decorate the living room, for all us kids to see
When I hear the Sunday bells ringing in the morning
I remember crying when she used to sing
Oh, mama liked the roses but most of all she cared
About the way we learned to live
And if we said our prayers
You know I kept the family bible
With a rose that she saved inside
It was pressed between the pages
Like it had found a place to hide
Oh, mama liked the roses in such a special way
We bring them every Mother's Day
And put them on her grave
Oh, mama liked the roses Mmmm
Mama liked the roses
Well, I've got a woman way across town
She's good to me, oh yeah
Say, I've got a woman way across town
She's gives me money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a kind of friend to me
I've got a woman way across town
She's good to me, oh-oh yeah
She saves her loving, early in the morning
Just for me, oh yeah
She saves her loving
Just for me
Yeah, you know she loves me so tenderly
She's there to love me both day and night
No groans or fusses, just treats me right
Never running in the streets, leaving me alone
She knows a woman's place is right there, now, in her home
Well, she's my baby, oh, don't you understand
And I'm her loving man
Oh, don't you know she's alright
She's alright, she's alright
I got a woman way over town
Good to me, oh yeah
Well, I quit my job down at the car wash
I left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown I'd left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
For the next three weeks I went hunting them nights
Just looking for a place to play
Well, I thought my picking would set them on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man
Well, I nearly about starved to death down in Memphis
I run out to money and luck
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia
On a overloaded poultry truck
I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started picking out some of them all night bars
Hoping I could make myself a dollar
Making music on my guitar
I got the same old story at them all night piers
There is no room around here for a guitar man
We don't need a guitar man, son
So I slept in the hobo jungles
Roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama
At a club they call Big Jack's
A little four-piece band was jamming
So I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed them what a band would sound like
With a swinging little guitar man
Show them, son
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jack's
If you got a little time to kill
Just follow that crowd of people
You'll wind up out on his dance floor
Digging the finest little five-piece group
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico
Guess who's leading that five-piece band
Well, wouldn't you know, it's that swinging little guitar man
Well, I came a long way from the car wash
Got to where I said I'd get
Now that I'm here I know for sure
I really have not got there yet
Think I'll start all over
Swing my guitar over my back
I'm going to get myself back on the track
I'll never, never ever look back
I'll never be more than what I am
Wouldn't you know
I'm a swinging little Guitar man
A very old friend came by today
Because he was telling everyone in town
About the love that he just found
And Marie's the name of his latest flame
Though I smiled the tears inside were a-burning
I wished him luck and then he said goodbye
He was gone but still his words kept returning
What else was there for me to do but cry
He talked and talked and I heard him say
That she had the longest blackest hair
The prettiest green eyes anywhere
Would you believe that yesterday
This girl was in my arms and swore to me
She'd be mine eternally
She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me, she loves me
The lady loves me and it shows
In spite of the way she turns up her nose
I'm her ideal, her hearts desire
Under that ice she's burning like fire
She'd like to cuddle up to me
She's playing hard to get
The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet
The gentleman has savoir-faire
As much as an elephant or a bear
I'd like to take him for a spin
Back to the zoo to visit his kin
He's got about as much appeal as a soggy cigarette
The lady loathes him but he doesn't know it yet
The lady's got a crush on me
The gentleman's crazy obviously
The lady's dying to be kissed
The gentleman needs a psychiatrist
I'd rather kiss a rattlesnake
Or play Russian roulette
She's falling fast she's on the skids
Both of his heads are flipping their lids
Tonight she'll hold me in her arms
I'd rather be holding hydrogen bombs
Will someone tell this Romeo
I'm not his Juliet
She wants me
Like poison ivy
Needs me
Like a hole in the head
Everyone can see she's got it bad
He's mad!
The gentleman is an egotist
I'm simply aware I'm hard to resist
He's one man I could learn to hate
How's about having dinner at eight
I'd rather dine with Frankenstein
In a moonlight tete-a-tete
Oh yes she loves me
Dig that shrinking violet
Oh she really loves me
Here's one gal you'll never get
She lo- lo- loves me
Would you like to make a bet
I said the lady loves me
The gentleman's all wet
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where those tree-tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleighbells in the snow
With every Christmas card I write
"May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white"
I-I-I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
Aloha ‘oe, aloha‘oe
E ke onaona noho i ka lipo
One fond embrace
A ho‘i a‘e au
Until we meet again
'Til we meet again
The people ask me how
How I've lived till now
I tell them I don't know
I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand
And yes I know how lonely life can be
Shadows follow me
The night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me
And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do
The book of life is brief
Once the page is read
All but love is dead
This is my believe
Every time you kiss me
I'm still not certain that you love me
Every time you hold me
I'm still not certain that you care
Though you keep on saying
You really, really, really love me
Do you speak the same words
To someone else when I'm not there
Suspicion torments my heart
Suspicion keeps us apart
Suspicion why torture me
Every time you call me
And tell me we should meet tomorrow
I can't help but think that
You're meeting someone else tonight
Why should our romance just
Keep on causing me such sorrow?
Why am I so doubtful
Whenever you're out of sight?
Darling, if you love me
I beg you wait a little longer
Wait until I drive all
These foolish fears out of my mind
How I hope and pray that
Our love will keep on growing stronger
Maybe I'm suspicious
Cause true love is so hard to find
You're so young and beautiful
Your lips so red, your eyes that shine
Shame the stars that glow
So fill these lonely arms of mine
And kiss me tenderly
Then you'll be forever young
And beautiful to me
You're everything I love
Your angel smile, your gentle touch
Are all I'm dreaming of
Oh, take this heart I offer you
And never set me free
We're going up, we're going down
We're going up, down, down, up
Any way you wanna let it roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You got me doin' what you want me
Oh, baby, what you want me to do
You got me peeping, you got me hiding
You got me peep, hide, hide, peep
There's a man in New Orleans who plays rock and roll
He's a guitar man with a great big soul
He lays down a beat like a ton of coal
He goes by the name of King Creole
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumping like a catfish on a pole
Hip-shaking King Creole
When the king starts to do it, it's as good as done
He holds his guitar like a tommy gun
He starts to growl from way down in his throat
He bends a string and that's all she wrote
Jumping like a catfish on a pole, yeah
Hip-shaking King Creole (King Creole)
Well, he sings a song about a crawdad hole
He sings a song about a jelly roll
He sings a song about a-pork and greens
He sings some blues about New Orleans
Jumping like a catfish on a pole yeah
Hip-shaking King Creole (King Creole, go)
He plays something evil, then he plays something sweet
No matter how he plays, you gotta get up on your feet
When he gets a rocking fever, baby, heaven sakes
He don't stop playing till his guitar breaks
Hip-shaking King Creole (Creole, Creole, Creole)
I've had nothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
There's no hope for tomorrow
How's the world treating you?
Every sweet thing that mattered
Has been broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you're away
And I'm asking you, darling
Well you rock my soul
Down in the bosom of Abraham
Rock, rock, rock down in the bosom of Abraham
You rock my soul down in the bosom of Abraham
Hmmm hmm oh yeah
Oh Lordy, Lordy
Ooooh rock my soul
Why don't you rock my soul?
Won't you rock my soul?
You rock my soul
Well the rich man lives
Where there's glory and honor
He lives so well
Won't you praise the Lord?
Children, when he dies
I'm home in heaven
Why don't your rock my soul?
Hmm hmm, oh yeah
Once again boys
Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, let me stand
I'm tired, I'm weak, I'm lone
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home
When my way grows drear (precious Lord)
Precious Lord, linger near (precious Lord)
When my light is almost gone
Hear my cry, hear my call
Hold my hand lest I fall
When the darkness appears
And the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
At the river I stand
Guide my feet, hold my hand
Precious Lord, take my hand (precious Lord)
Lead me on, let me stand (precious Lord)
(Lead me home)
I left my home in Norfolk Virginia
California on my mind
I straddled that Greyhound
And rode into Raleigh
And on across Caroline
We had motor trouble that turn into a struggle
Halfway across Alabama
And that hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham
Right away I brought me a through train ticket
Riding across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just to help me get to Houston Town
There are people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born brought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hand
And I woke up high over Alberquerque
On a jet to the promised land
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the golden state
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
He would set us at the terminal gate
Swing low chariot come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia
Tidewater four ten o nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy is on the line
Tell me why?
Oh why, oh why can't my dream come true?
Oh why?
[Verse 2: Carrie Underwood & 
Shawn Mendes
]
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear?
[Verse 3: Post Malone & 
Darius Rucker
We're lost in a cloud with too much rain
We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain (Oh yeah)
As long as a man has the strength to dream
[Verse 4: Elvis Presley & 
Blake Shelton
Deep in my heart there's a tremblin' question
Still I am sure that the answer
Answer's gonna come somehow
Oh, please let my dream come true
Thank you, good night
(Christmas, Christmas, Christmas)
Well, it's Christmas time, pretty baby
And the snow is falling on the ground
(Christmas, Christmas)
And the snow is falling down
Well, you be a real good little girl
Santa Claus is back in town
Got no sleigh with reindeer
No sack on my back
You're gonna see me comin'
In a big black Cadillac
Oh, it's Christmas time, pretty baby (Christmas, Christmas)
And the snow is falling on the ground (Christmas, Christmas)
Well you be a real good little baby
(Christmas)
Hang up your pretty stockings
And turn off the light
Santa Claus is comin'
Down your chimney tonight
Well, you be a real good little baby
Have I told you lately that I love you?
Could I tell you once again somehow?
Have I told with all my heart and soul how I adore you?
Well darling, I'm telling you now
Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping
Every dream I dream is you somehow?
Have I told you why the nights are long
When you're not with me?
My heart would break in two if I should lose you
I'm no good without you anyhow
And have I told you lately that I love you
I believe for every drop of rain that falls
A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows
I believe for everyone who goes astray
Someone will come to show the way
I believe, I believe
I believe above a storm the smallest prayer
Can still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word
Every time I hear a new born baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why
I believe (believe, I believe)
I believe (I believe)
When you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes I will dry them all
I'm on your side, oh when time gets rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
When you're down and out, when you're on the streets
When evening falls so hard, I will comfort you
I'll take your part, oh when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Sail on, silver girl, sail on by
Your time has come to shine, all your dreams are on their way
See how they shine, oh if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
I will ease your mind
I will ease your mind..
Without Him I could do nothing
Without Him I'd surely fail
Without Him I would be drifting
Like a ship without a sail
Without Him I would be dying
Without Him I'd be enslaved
Without Him life would be worthless
But with Jesus thank God I'm saved
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus
Do you know Him today
Please don't turn Him away
Oh Jesus, my Jesus
Without Him how lost I would be
Well, well, well just because you think you're so pretty
And just because your momma thinks you're hot
Well, just because you think you've got something
That no other girl has got
You've caused me to spend all my money
You laughed and called me old Santa Claus
Well, I'm telling you, baby, I'm through with you
Because, well well, just because
Well, well, well there'll come a time when you'll be lonesome
And there'll come a time when you'll be blue
Well, there'll come a time when old Santa
He won't pay your bills for you
You've caused me to lose all my women
And now, now you say we are through
Well, I'm telling you, baby, I was through with you
A long, long, long time ago
Well, just because you think you're so pretty
And just because your mama thinks you're the hottest thing in town
That nobody else has got
You've caused me to spend all of my money
Honey, you laughed and called me your old Santa Claus
When you walk through a storm hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of a storm is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Tho' your dreams be tossed and blown
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never, ever walk alone
Never found a four leaf clover
To bring good luck to me
No rabbit's foot, no lucky star
No magic wishing tree
But I got lucky, yes, I got lucky
(I got lucky, lucky when)
When I found you, oh oh, yeah
Got no rainbow around my shoulder
No horseshoe on my door
But I got you to hold me tight
And who could ask for more
Oh, I got lucky, yes, I got lucky
When I found you
(When I found you)
I always walk around
With all my fingers crossed
I'm afraid the love I found
Just might get lost
So won't you tell me that you love me
Hurry up and name the day
And then I'll know that my good luck
Is really here to stay
(I got lucky)
No more do I see the starlight caress your hair
No more feel the tender kisses we used to share
I close my eyes and clearly my heart remembers
A thousand good-byes could never put out the embers
Darling I love you so and my heart forever
Will belong to the memory of the love that we knew before
Please come back to my arms, we belong together
Come to me let's be sweethearts again and then let us part no more
No more do I feel the touch of your hand on mine
No more see the love light 
making your dark eyes shine
Oh how I wish I never had caused you sorrow
But don't ever say for us there is no tomorrow
When the storms of life are raging
Stand by me
When the world is tossing me
Like a ship out on the sea
Thou who rulest wind and water
When I'm growing old and feeble
When I do the best I can
And my friends misunderstand
Thou who never lost a battle
In my father's house are many mansions
If it were not true he would have told me so
He has gone away to live in that bright city
He's preparing me a mansion there I know
Jesus died upon the cross to bear my sorrow
Freely died that souls like you might have new life
But I know that soon there'll come a bright tomorrow
When the world will all be free from sin and strife
(Do not shun the savior's love, from up in glory)
(Or you won't be there to sing the gospel story)
If you're true then to this land you'll surely go
Well Lawdy, Lawdy, Lawdy miss Clawdy
Girl you sure look good to me
But please don't excite me baby
I know it can't be me
Well as a girl you want my money
Yeah but you just won't treat me right
You like to ball every morning
Don't come home till late at night
Oh going to tell, tell my mama
Lord, I swear girl what you been to me
I'm going to tell everybody that I'm down in misery
So bye, bye, bye, baby
Girl, I won't be coming no more
Goodbye little darling down the road I'll go
So, bye, bye, bye baby
Goodbye Little Darling down the road I'll go
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
It's called rubberneckin' baby well that's all right with me
It's called rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me
People say I'm wasting time, but they don't really know
I like what I see and I see what I like, it gives me such a glow
First thing in the morning, last thing at night
I look, stare everywhere and see everything in sight
Hey hey hey
Some people say I'm wasting time, but they don't really know
I see what I like and I like what I see, it gives me such a glow
Sitting' on the back porch all by myself
Along came Mary Jane with somebody else
Well, stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
Some people say I'm wasting time yeh, but I don't really care
I like what I see, I see what I like yeh, it gives me such a glow
Hey baby, I ain't asking much of you
No no no no no no no no baby, I ain't asking much of you
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk of love will do
Don't be a stingy little mama
You're 'bout to starve me half to death
Now you can spare a kiss or two and
Still have plenty left, no no no
Baby, I ain't asking much of you
You're just a natural born beehive
Filled with honey to the top
But I ain't greedy, baby
All I want is all you got, no no no
I ain't asking much of you
I got a wishbone in my pocket
I got a rabbit foot around my wrist
You know I'd have all of the things my lucky charms could bring
If you give me just a one sweet kiss
Oh no no no no no no no no
Just a big a hunk o' hunk o' hunk o' love will do, that's right
Just a big a big a big a hunk o' love will do, that's right
Just a big a big a big a hunk o' love
Today I stumbled from my bed
With thunder crashing in my head
My pillow still wet
From last night tears
And as I think of giving up
A voice inside my coffee-cup
Kept crying out, ringing in my ears
Don't cry daddy
Daddy, please don't cry
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
Daddy ride us on your back again
Oh, daddy, please don't cry
Why are children always first
To feel the pain and hurt the worst
It's true, but somehow
It just don't seem right
Cause every time I cry I know
It hurts my little children so
I wonder will it be the same tonight
I'll remember you
Long after this 
endless summer
 has gone
I'll be lonely, oh so lonely
Living only to remember you
Your voice as soft as the warm summer breeze
Your sweet laughter, mornings after
Ever after, I'll remember you
To your arms someday, I'll return to stay
Till then I will remember too
Every bright star we made wishes upon
Love me always, promise always
Ooh, you'll remember too
(I'll remember you)
The way she walks, the way she talks
How long can I pretend
Oh, I can't help it, I'm in love
With the girl of my best friend
Her lovely hair, her skin so fair
I could go on and never end
I want to tell her how I love her so
And hold her in my arms, but then
What if she got real mad and told him so
I could never face either one again
The way they kiss, their happiness
Will my aching heart ever mend?
Or will I always be in love
With the girl of my best friend?
Never end
Will it ever end?
Please let it end
You know the landlord rang my front doorbell
I let it ring for a long, long spell
I went to the window, I peeped through the blind
And asked him to tell me what's on his mind
He said, "Money, honey
Money, honey
If you want to get along with me"
Well, I screamed and I hollered, I was so hard-pressed
I called the woman that I loved the best
I finally got my baby about half-past three
She said, "I'd like to know what you want with me"
I said, "Money, honey
Well, I said, "Tell me, baby, what's wrong with you?"
"From this day on our romance is through"
I said, "Tell me, baby, face to face
How could another man take my place?"
She said, "Money, honey
Well, I've learned my lesson and now I know
The sun may shine and the winds may blow
The women may come and the women may go
But before I say "I love you so"
I want money, honey
If you want to get along with me
Ku‘u ipo I love you more today
More today than yesterday
But I love you less today
Less than I will tomorrow
See the sweet Hawaiian rose
See it blossom see it grow
That's the story of our love
Ever since we said hello
As the years go passing by
We'll recall our wedding day
I will be there by your side
You will always hear me say
Ku‘u ipo,ku‘u ipo,  you're my Hawaiian sweetheart
Welcome to my world
Won't you come on in
Miracles, I guess
Still happen now and then
Step into my heart
Leave your cares behind
Built with you in mind
Knock and the door shall be opened
Seek and you will find
Ask and you'll be given
The key to this heart of mine
I'll be waiting there
With my arms unfurled
Waiting just for you
Well, it's Saturday night and I just got paid
A fool about my money, don't try to save
My heart says go, go, have a time
'Cause it's Saturday night, babe, and I'm feeling' fine
I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
Have a ball tonight
Well, I got me a date and I won't be late
I picked her up in my '88'
Shag on down to the social hall
When the music starts jumpin', I'll have a ball
And ball tonight
Along about ten I'll be flying high
I'll walk on out into open sky
But I don't care if I spend my dough
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul
And a ball tonight
Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops falling soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the Good times
I'll get along, you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
For the good times
Kiss me quick, while we still have this feeling
Hold me close and never let me go
Cause tomorrows can be so uncertain
Love can fly and leave just hurting
Kiss me quick because I love you so
Kiss me quick and make my heart go crazy
Sigh that sigh and whisper oh so low
Tell me that tonight will last forever
Say that you will leave me never
Let the band keep playing while we are swaying
Let's keep on praying that we'll never stop
Kiss me quick just can't stand this waiting
Cause your lips are lips I long to know
Oh that kiss will open heaven's door
And we'll stay there forevermore
Smile an everlasting smile
A smile could bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you're gone
Cause that could bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory
Let's start a brand new story now, my love
Right now, there'll be no other time
And I can show you all, my love
Talk and everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
It's here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say
It's only words and words are all I have
To take your heart away
Play it James
To steal your heart away
To steal your heart away, heart away, ya baby
All the words that I let her know
Still could not say
How much I need you so
In every way
I will hope you will guide me
And only you can do
Hold my hands down beside me
I'm counting on you
I'm counting on you, dear
From the dawn of each day
To always come through, dear
In your kind loving way
If you knew just how deeply
I feel things you do
Then you'll know how completely
Well, it's hard to be a gambler
Betting' on the number
That changes every time
Well, you think you're gonna win
Think she's givin' in
A stranger's all you find
Yeah, it's hard to figure out
What she's all about
That she's a woman through and through
She's a complicated lady, so color my baby moody blue
Oh, Moody blue
Tell me am I gettin' through
I keep hanging' on
Try to learn your song
But I never do
Tell me who I'm talking' to
You're like night and day
And it's hard to say
Which one is you
Well, when Monday comes she's Tuesday
When Tuesday comes she's Wednesday
Into another day again
Her personality unwinds
Just like a ball of twine
On a spool that never ends
Just when I think I know her well
Her emotions reveal
She's not the person that
I thought I knew
The way she moves her hips up to her fingertips
I feel I'm heaven bound
And when she starts to sway, I've gotta say
She really moves the grass around
Rock-a-hula baby
Got a hula lulu from Honolulu
That rock-a-hula baby of mine
Although I love to kiss my little hula miss
I never get the chance
I wanna hold her tight all through the night
But all she wants to do is dance
Oh that Rock-a-hula baby of mine
Once I stood in the night
With my head bowed low
In the darkness as black as could be
And my heart felt alone and I cried oh Lord
Don't hide your face from me
Like a king I may live in a palace so tall
With great riches to call my own
But I don't know a thing
In this whole wide world
That's worse than being alone
Hold my hand all the way, every hour every day
Come here to the great unknown
Take my hand, let me stand
Where no one stands alone
Come on everybody and snap your fingers now
Come on everybody clap your hands real loud
Come on everybody take a real deep breath
And repeat after me
Loving my baby
Hey, hey, hey and my baby loves me
Come on everybody and whistle this tune right now
Come on everybody and stomp your feet real loud
Well there ain't nothing wrong with the long-haired music
Like Brahms, Beethoven and Bach
Well I was raised with a guitar in my hand
And I was born to rock
Well, come on everybody and turn your head to the left
Come on everybody and turn your head to the right
If you find your sweetheart
In the arms of a friend
That's when your heartaches begin
When dreams of a lifetime
Must come to an end
Love is a thing
You never can share
If you bring a friend
Into your love affair
That's the end of your sweetheart
That's the end of your friend
In the arms of your best friend
Brother, that's- that's when your heartaches begin
Fame and fortune
How empty they can be
But when I hold you in my arms
That's heaven to me
Who cares for fame and fortune
They're only passing things
But the touch of your lips on mine
Makes me feel like a king
Your kind of love
Is a treasure I hold
It's so much greater
Than silver or gold
I know that I have nothing
If you should go away
But to know that you love me
Brings fame and fortune my way
(Now and then there's a fool such as I)
Pardon me, if I'm sentimental
When we say goodbye
Don't be angry with me should I cry
When you're gone, yet I'll dream
A little dream as years go by
Now and then there's a fool such as I (fool such as I)
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love
And now you say that we are through
I'm a fool, but I'll love you, dear
Until the day I die
Now and then there's a fool such as I
I was the one who taught her to kiss
The way that she kisses you now
And you know the way she touches your cheek
Well, I taught her how
I was the one who taught her to cry
When she wants you under her spell
The sight of her tears drives you out of your mind
I taught her so well
And then one day
I had my love as perfect as could be
She lived, she loved, she laughed, she cried
And it was all for me
I'll never know who taught her to lie
Now that it's over and done
Who learned the lesson when she broke my heart?
I was the one
I'm so hurt to think that you lied to me
I'm hurt way down deep inside of me
You said our love was true and we'll never, never part
Now you've got someone new and it breaks my heart
I'm hurt, much more than you'll ever know
Yes darling, I'm so hurt because I still love you so
But even though you hurt me like nobody else could ever do
I would never ever hurt you, oh you, not you
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen, Blitzen, all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say a prayer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight
He's got a bag that's filled with toys
For boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
What a beautiful sight
Jump in bed and cover up your head
He doesn't care if you're rich or poor
He loves you just the same
Santa knows that we're God's children
That makes everything right
Fill your hearts with Christmas cheer
Well, here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
He'll come around when the chimes ring out
It's Christmas morn again
Peace on Earth will come to all
If we just follow the light
Let's give thanks to the Lord above
I'm a steamroller baby
I'm about to roll all over you
I'm going to inject your soul
With sweet rock and roll, poor heaven
I'm a cement mixer
A churning urn of burning funk
I’m a demolition derby
A hefty hunk, steaming junk
With some sweet rock and roll
And shoot you full of rhythm and blues
I'm a napalm bomb
Guaranteed to blow your mind
If I can't have your love now baby
There won't be nothing left behind
The old hometown looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
All creatures smiling sweetly
The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I'll walk with my sweet Mary
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
Then I awake and look around me
Four gray walls surround me
And I realize I was only dreaming
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home
Don't leave me now (don't leave me now)
Now that I need you (ooh)
How blue and lonely I'd be
If you should say we're through (don't say we're through)
Don't break my heart (don't break my heart)
This heart that loves you (ooh)
There'd just be nothing for me
If you should leave me now (don't leave me now)
What good is dreaming
If I must dream all alone by myself
Without you, darling (darling)
My arms would gather dust
Like a book on the shelf
Come to these arms (come to these arms)
These arms that need you (ooh)
Don't close your eyes to my plea
Don't you leave me now (don't you leave me now)
We've got to patch it up baby
Before we fall apart at the seams
We can't let time unravel our dreams
Let's go back and touch the past
One more night is all I ask
Get that feeling, that old feeling, feelin-eelin'
We can patch it up baby
Patch it up with a whole lotta' love
We got to patch it up baby
Let's sweep out all the cobwebs in our hearts
Before indifference pulls us apart
Don't let a good love die
Lets give it just one more try
With that feeling, that old feeling, feelin-eelin'
Forever my darling
Our love will be true
Always and forever
I'll love only you
Just promise me darling
Your love in return
May this fire in my soul dear
Forever burn
My heart's at your command dear
To keep, love and to hold
Making you happy's my desire
Keeping you is my goal
I'll forever love you
For the rest of my days
I'll never part from you
For your loving ways
Making you happy's my desire dear
Loving you is my goal
:
When it comes to twistin'
I just got to keep insisting
Oh Baby
You sure do swing
Oh Daddy
Hey, you are the king
Baby, you've got me beat
Up and down, inside out and across
Oh yeah!
And in the middle of the night
When the moon is shining bright
Ah! You're the boss
Hey!
Talkin 'bout a dancin' and a down on romancin'
Big daddy, hey!
You make the scene
Talkin' 'bout dancin' and down on romancin'
Oh now baby
You are the queen
Oh when push comes to shove
When it comes down to love
You're a horse!
But in the middle of the night
Baby, you're the boss!
You're the best of everything
You're a peach
You're a plum
You're a diamond
You're a pearl
Ahh daddy you're my man
Mmmm Baby you're my girl
Now when it comes to knowin'
Which way the wind is blowin'
Now baby, you sure are wise
Yeah! When it comes to knowin'
Oh daddy, you take the prize
Baby you're a genius
When it comes to cooking up some chili sauce
Oh but in the middle of the night
Ahh, you're the boss
You're the boss
But in the middle of the night when the moon is shining bright
Baby, you're the boss
Oh well, I'm tired and so weary
But I must go alone
Till the Lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
Well the morning's so bright
And the lamp is alight
And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me, someday
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me
Well, the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be led by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me
Well then, I, John, he saw a mighty number
Way up in the middle of the air
Well, I, John, he saw a mighty number
Way in the middle of the air
Got to mighty move
That I, John, he saw mighty number
Well, I, John, he was a mighty number
Well there were
Three gates in the east
(And there were)
Three gates in the west
(Let me tell you 'bout em)
Three gates in the north
(Hallelujah there were...)
Three gates in the south
And that makes twelve gates to the city
All square wide
Hallelujah, got to mighty move
Well John declared that he saw a man
He held twelve bright stars in his right hand
Well his eyes flashed fire like the burning sun
Old John got scared and wanted to run
Well he wanted to run but his feet wouldn't go
Cause he felt the gospel cutting like a two-edged sword
And he heard a voice that said John, you take a look
And read what you see and then you write it in a book
And he saw twelve angels in the east
And there were twelve angels in the west
Hallelujah, brother
Twelve angels in the north
Twelve angels in the south
That's a total of forty-eight angels to the city
Four squared wide
I was always, baby, I was always
Well almost always true to you
Met a pretty mademoiselle
Her papa owned a small hotel
Oh, I was almost always true to you
I resisted, though my arm was twisted
I was almost always true to you
I stayed away from drinking wine
Thought about you all the time
Kept refusing, don't jump to conclusions
I would never grab like this
I would never steal a kiss
Babe, you're getting closer
The lights are going dim
The sound of your breathing
Has made the mood I'm in
All of my resistance
Is lying on the floor
Taking me to places
I've never been before
Ooh, and I can feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it
Way down where the music plays
Way down like a tidal wave
Way down where the fires blaze
Way down, down, way, way on down
Ooh, my head is spinning
You got me in your spell
A hundred magic fingers
On a whirling carousel
The medicine within me
No doctor could prescribe
Your love is doing something
That I just can't describe
Hold me again
Tight as you can
I need you so
Baby, let's go
I wanna soothe my my heart, I wanna ease my mind
I wanna move my shoes and see what I can find
I wanna stand up tall and open up my eyes
I wanna reach out my hand until I touch the skies
I was a poor lost lamb in a deep dark hole
But now I've found that light I'm gonna save my soul
I used to drink, I used to smoke
I used to smoke, drink and dance the hoochy-coo
I used to smoke and drink, smoke and drink and dance the hoochy-coo
Oh yeah and now I'm standing on this corner praying for me and you
I-I-I that's why I'm saved I'm saved
People let me tell you 'bout kingdom come
You know I'm saved I'm saved
Well I can preach until you're deaf and dumb
I'm in that soul saving army beating on that big bass drum
I used to cuss, I used to fuss
I used to fuss, cuss, boogie all night long
I used to cuss and fuss, cuss and fuss
Cuss and fuss and boogie all night long
Well, now I'm standing on this corner, I know right from wrong
I used to lie, I used to cheat
I used to lie, cheat, steal from people's feet
I used to lie and cheat, lie and cheat and steal from people's feet
Well, now I'm stepping on to glory salvation in my beat
Because I'm saved, I'm saved
I am saved I'm saved
Well, I can preach until you're deaf and dumb
Oh yeah, because I'm saved, I'm saved
I'm saved, I'm saved I'm saved
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
Stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never learned to read or write so well
But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell
Go, go, go Johnny go, go, go Johnny, go go
Go Johnny go, go, go Johnny go go
Johnny B. Goode
His mama told him "someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear your playing music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday you will be in lights saying Johnny B. Goode"
They give us a room
With a view of the beautiful Rhine
Give me a muddy old creek
In Texas any old time
I've got those hup, two, three, four
Occupation G.I. Blues
From my G.I. hair to the heels of my G.I. shoes
And if I don't go stateside soon
I'm gonna blow my fuse
We get hasenpfeffer
And black pumpernickel for chow
I'd blow my next month's pay
For a slice of Texas cow
We'd like to be heroes
But all we do here is march
And they don't give the Purple Heart
For a fallen arch
The frauleins are pretty as flowers
But we can't make a pass
Cause they're all wearing signs saying:
"Keepen sie off the grass"
It was a night, ooh, what a night
It was, it really was such a night
The moon was bright, oh, how so bright
The night was alight with stars above
Ooh, when she kissed me, I had to fall in love
Oh, it was a kiss, ooh, what a kiss
It was, it really was such a kiss
Oh, how she could kiss, oh, what a kiss
It was it really was such a kiss
Just the thought of her lips sets me afire
I reminisce and I'm filled with desire
But I'd gave my heart to her in sweet surrender
How well I remember, I'll always remember
Oh, what a night, ooh, what a night
Came the dawn and my heart and her love
And the night was gone
But I'll never forget the kiss, the kiss in the moonlight
Ooh, such a kiss, such a night
That night, ooh, what a night
When we kissed, I had to fall in love
Oh, that night, ooh, what a night
Well, she's gone, gone, gone
Yes, she's gone, gone, gone
Came the dawn, dawn, dawn
And my love was gone
But before that dawn
Yes, before that dawn and before that dawn
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah
Such a night
If I have wounded any soul today
If I have caused one's foot to go astray
If I have walked in my own willful way
Dear Lord for-give
For-give the sins I have confessed to Thee
For-give the secret sins I do not see
Oh guide watch over me and my keeper be
Dear Lord, a-a-men, a-a-men
I got a woman, mean as she can be
Sometimes I think she's almost mean as me
A black cat up and died of fright
'Cause she crossed his path last night
Kissed so hard, she bruise my lips
Hurts so good, my heart just flips
Strangest girl I ever had
Never happy unless she's mad
Yeah, huh
She makes love without a smile
Ooh, hot dog, it drives me wild
Some of you all never been down South too much
I'm going to tell you a little story, so you'll understand where I'm talking about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods and the fields
And it looks something like a turnip green
Everybody calls it Polk salad. Now that's Polk salad
Used to know a girl that lived down there and
She'd go out in the evenings to pick a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper, because that's about all they had to eat
But they did all right
Down in Louisiana
Where the alligators grow so mean
Lived a girl that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame
Polk salad Annie
Alligators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
For the mama was working on the chain-gang
What a mean, vicious woman
Everyday before suppertime
She'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of Polk salad
And carry it home in a tote sack
Alligators got you granny
Because the mama was working on the chain-gang
Whoo, how wretched, despiteful, straight-razor toting woman
Lord have mercy
Sock a little Polk salad to him
Yeah, you know what, yeah, yeah
But daddy was a lazy and a no-count
Claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for
Was stealing watermelons out of my truck
You know what meets a meal mention
You sock a little
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Chic a bon, chic a bon, chic a bon bon bon bon
Chinc, chinc, chinc, chin, ling, ling ling
Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey
And perhaps never meet anymore
Till we gather in heaven's bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore
If we never meet again this side of heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven
By the side of the river of life
Where the charming roses bloom forever
And where separations come no more
I will meet you on that beautiful shore
I hear the bells
Saying Christmas is near
They ring out to tell the world
That this is the season of cheer
I hear a choir
Singing sweetly somewhere
And a glow fills my heart
I'm at peace with the world
As the sound of their singing fills the air
Oh why can't every day be like Christmas
Why can't that feeling go on endlessly
For if every day could be just like Christmas
What a wonderful world this would be
I hear a child
Telling Santa what to bring
And the smile upon his tiny face
Is worth more to me than anything
Get up in the morning feeling mighty weak
A tossing and a turning well, I ain't had no sleep
Oh baby, what road's our love taking?
To romance or heartbreaking
Won't you say which way you're going to go
I got to know, got to know, got to know
Nine and nine make fourteen, four and four make nine
The clock is striking thirteen I think I lost my mind
You know it's getting aggravating
How long can I keep waiting?
Tell me if you love me yes or no
Oh, how much I need you
Have pity on this heart of mine
Well, if you need and want me too
I'll be your one and only till the end of time
Saw the fortune teller, had my fortune read
She sent me to the doctor, who sent me straight to bed
He said I'm lonesome and I'm lovesick
I've got my mind on lipstick
Will you kiss away my cares and woe?
Listen easy, you can hear God calling
Walking barefoot by the stream
Come on to me, Your hair's softly falling
On my face as in a dream
And the time will be our time
And the grass won't pay no mind
Saying nothing, lying where the sun is
Baking down upon our sides
My lips touch you, with their soft wet kisses
Your hands gentle in reply
Child, touch my soul with your cries
And the music will know what we've found
I, hear a hundred good-byes
But today I hear only one sound
The moment we're living is now
Now now now now now now now
Young bird flying, and a soft wind blowing
Cools the sweat inside my palms
Close my eyes, hear the flowers growing
As you lay sleeping in my arms
No the grass won't pay no mind
Well, I heard the news
There's good rocking tonight
I'm gonna hold my baby
As tight as I can
Tonight she'll know
I'm a mighty, mighty man
I heard the news
I say, well, meet me in a hurry
Behind the barn
Don't you be afraid, darling
I'll do you no harm
I want you to bring
Along my rocking shoes
'Cause tonight I'm gonna rock away
All my blues
Well, we're gonna rock
We're gonna rock
Let's rock
Come on and rock
All our blues away
Have you heard the news?
Everybody's rocking tonight
Well, we're gonna rock, rock, rock
Come on and rock, rock, rock
Well, rock, rock, rock, rock
Let's rock, rock, rock, rock
We're gonna rock all our blues away
When I was a lad
And old Shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way
I remember the time
At the old swimmin' hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old Shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pull me out
As the years fast did roll
Old Shep, he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor
Looked at me and said
"I can do no more for him, Jim"
With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead
He came to my side
And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend
That a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see
Old Shep, he has gone
Where the good doggies go
And no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven
There's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home
You're sleeping son
, I know
But, really, this can't wait
I wanted to explain
Before it gets too late
For your mother and me
Love has finally died
This is no happy home
But God knows how I've tried
Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy
I know it's hard to understand
Why did we ever start?
We're more like strangers now
Each acting out a part
I have laughed, I have cried
I have lost every game
Taken all I can take
But I'll stay here just the same
Sleep on, you haven't heard a word
Perhaps it's just as well
Why spoil your little dreams
Why put you through the hell
Life is no fairytale
As one day you will know
But now you're just a child
I'll stay here and watch you grow
Didja' ever
Didja' ever get
Didja' ever get one
Didja' ever get one of them (daays)
Didja' ever get one of them days, boys
Didja' ever get one of them days
When nothing is right from morning till night
Ya get up in the morning and turn the shower on
You're getting pneumonia, the hot hot water is gone
Freezing, sneezing
You wanna dry your back, well
When there's no towel on the rack
Didja' ever get one of them
Didja' ever get one of them girls, boys
Didja' ever get one of them girls
Who's awful nice
But cold as ice
Didja' ever get one of them girls, yeah
Yeah! Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls
You're at a drive-in movie
With a cute brunette
A counting on the kisses that you figure to get
Closer, closer, then she hollers ho!
Who just wants to watch the show
Show, show, show, show, show, show, show, show
You're on a Sunday picnic
And then it starts to pour
You run through poison ivy, scratch until you're sore
Ants come dancing, carry off the bread
When you should a-stayed in bed
Yesterday has slipped away
And the sun is welcoming the evening shadows
Of a perfect day and the next step is love
The next step is love
We've walked barefoot through the misty meadows
Laughing at each other in the rain
Made some faces at some people in the park
And didn't bother to explain
Fun, fun, look at us run
Going nowhere special really fast
But we've yet to taste the icing on the cake
That we've been baking with the past
And the next step is love
So what are we waiting for?
Girl, it's for sure
On a perfect day and the next step is love
Love will be a place to run to
From the world they've willed you and me
We'll be closer than we've ever been
Though looking back it's so hard to believe
Hang it all out, we bring it on in
The best we've picked up on the way to now
Changes are coming but together
We can make it through somehow
Cause the next step is love
Yesterday, has slipped away
Yes it's love
Next step is love
Yes girl it's love
I play an old piano from nine till a half past one
Tryin' to make a livin' watchin' everybody have fun
Well, I don't miss much that ever happens on a dance hall floor
Mercy, look what just walked through that door
Well, hello T-R-0-U-B-L-E
What in the world you're doin' A-L-O-N-E?
Say, good L-double O-K-I-N-G
I smell T-R-O-U-B-L-E
I was a little bitty baby when my papa hit the skids
Mama had a time tryin' to raise nine kids
Told me not to stare cause it was impolite
And did the best she could to try to raise me right
But mama never told me 'bout nothing like Y-O-U
Say, your mama must have been another something or the other too
Say, hello good L-double O-K-I-N-G
Well, you talk about a woman I've seen a lot of others
But too much something' and not enough another
You've got it all together like a lovin' machine
Lookin' like glory and walkin' like a dream
Mother Nature's sure been good to Y-O-U
Well, your mama must have been another good lookin' too
Say, hey, good L-double O-K-I-N-G
Well, you talk about a trouble-makin' hunka pokey bait
The men are gonna love and all the women gonna hate
Reminding them of everything they never gonna be
Maybe the beginning of the World War III
Oh, the world ain't ready for nothin' like a Y-O-U
Well, I bet your mama must have been another something or the other too
Say hey good L-double O-K-I-N-G
Shackled by a heavy burden
Need the Lord again and shame
Then the hand of Jesus touched me
And now I am no longer the same
For he touched me
He touched me
And what a wonderful joy
Joy that foods my soul
Something happened and now I know
And made me whole
Oh since I met this blessed Savior
And since he cleansed and made me whole
Oh I never cease
Never cease to praise Him
I'll shout it while eternity rolls
Crawfish (crawfish)
Well I went to the bayou just last night
There was no moon but the stars were bright
Put a big long hook on a big long pole
And I pulled Mr. Crawfish out of his hole
See I got him, see the size
Stripped and cleaned before your eyes
Sweet meat, look
Fresh and ready to cook
Now take Mr. Crawfish in your hand
He's gonna look good in your frying pan
If you fry him crisp or you boil him right
He'll be sweeter than sugar when you take a bite
It hurts me to see him treat you the way that he does
It hurts me to see sit you and cry
When I know I could be so true
If I had someone like you
It hurts me to see those tears in your eyes
The whole town is talking, they're calling you a fool
For listening to his same old lies
And when I know I could be so true
It hurts me to see the way he makes you cry
You love him so much, you're too blind to see
He's only playing a game
He's never loved you
He never will
And, darling, don't you know he'll never change
I know that he never will set you free
Because he's just that kind of guy
But if you ever tell him you're through
I'll be waiting for you
Waiting to hold you so tight
Waiting to kiss you goodnight
Yes, darling, if I had someone like you
There's no joy in my heart, only sorrow
And I'm sad as a man can be
I sit alone in the darkness of my lonely room
And this room is a prison to me
I look out my window
And what do I see
I see a bird
Way up in a tree
I want to be free (oh yes) free (oh yes)
Free
I want to be free
Like a bird in a tree (wanna be free)
Oh, what good are my eyes, they can't see you
And my arms, they can't hold you so tight
I have two lips that are yearning
But they're no good to me
'Cause I know I can't kiss you tonight
Like a bird in a tree (want to be free)
You don't like crazy music
Don't like rocking bands
You just wanna go to a movie show
And sit there holding hands
You're so square
Baby, I don't care
You don't like hot rod racing
Or driving late at night
You just wanna park where it's nice and dark
You just wanna hold me tight
You don't know any dance steps that are new
But no one else could love me like you do, do, do, do
I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you, babe
I guess it's just because
Baby, I don't care, care, care, care
I don't care, care, care, care
Sul mare luccica
L'astro d'argento
Placida e' l'onda
Prospero e' il vento
Venite all'agile
Barchetta mia
Santa Lucia
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she moves me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe, and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
All I gotta do is think about her
Something in her style it shows me
You're asking me will our love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I'm a poor Hawaiian beach boy
A long way from the beach
Cause someone shoved his face against my hand
Now I'm a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
I'm in the can
I was minding my own business
Drinking daddy's juice
I swear I'll never touch that stuff again
Just like a pig before he gave his all at the lu'au
I'm in the pen
Got those beach boy blues
Don't the time go slow
Lonely beach boy blues
Only 30 days and 90 years to go
I want a taste of honey
From my 
wahine's
 lips
I want to be her ever loving man
But I'm a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
Living below in this old sinful world
Hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptation so
Now won't you tell me
Where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go oh where could I go
Seeking the refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to save me in the end
Won't you tell me
Life here is grand with friends I love so dear
Comfort I get from God's own word
Yet when I face that chilling hand of death
I just got your letter baby
Too bad you can't come home
I swear I'm going crazy
Sitting here all alone
Since you're gone
I got a mess of blues
I ain't slept a wink since Sunday
I can't eat a thing all day
Every day is just blue Monday
Since you've been away
Whoops there goes a teardrop
Rolling down my face
If you cry when you're in love
It sure ain't no disgrace
I got to get myself together
Before I lose my mind
I'm going to catch the next train going
And leave my blues behind
Since you're gone I got a mess of blues
Well I've never been to Spain
But I kind of like the music
Say the ladies are insane there
And they sure know how to use it
They don't abuse it
Never going to lose it
I can't refuse it
Well, I've never been to England
But I kind of like the Beatles
So I headed for Las Vegas
Only made it out to Needles
Can you feel it
Must be weary
Oh so good oh feel so good
Well I've never been to heaven
But I've been in Oklahoma
Well, they tell me I was born there
But I really don't remember
In Oklahoma or Arizona
What does it matter
If you want to be loved
Baby, you've got to love me too
Oh yeah, 'cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair
If you want to be kissed
Well, you've got to kiss me too
Oh yeah, if you want to be kissed
Well, fair exchange bears no robbery
And the whole world will know that it's true
Understanding solves all problems, baby
That's why I'm telling you
If you want to be hugged
Well, you got to hug me, too
Oh yeah, if you want to be hugged
Well, you've got to hug me, too
Well, if you know you can't take it
Baby, why try to give it?
If you know you can't take it
Then baby, why try to give it?
'Cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair
I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time
The day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we ever met
But something sure is wrong
'Cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget
Well, but something sure is wrong
(We'll understand it all by and by)
Tempted and tried we're oft' made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested, though in the wrong
Farther along we'll know more about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
When death has come and taken our loved ones
Leaving our homes so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder how others prosper
Living so wicked year after year
Who makes my heart beat like thunder?
Who makes my temperature rise?
Who makes me tremble with wonderful rapture
With one burning glance, from her eyes
Marguerita
Once I was free as a gypsy
A creature too wild to tame
Then suddenly I saw, Marguerita
And I was caught, like a moth in the flame
Marguerita is her name
Her lips have made me her prisoner
A slave to her every command
She captivates me, and intoxicates me
With one little touch of her hand
Sweet Marguerita sweet, sweet Marguerita
It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to keep my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
That keeps you in the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the backroads
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' caldron in some train yard
My beard a rustling, cold towel, and
A dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waiting from the backroads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind
Well I've got a gal, she's as cute as she can be
She's a distant cousin but she's not too distant with me
We'll kiss all night
I'll squeeze her tight
But we're Kissin cousins and that's what makes it all right
All right, all right, all right
Oh I've got a girl and she taught me how to live
She can give a lot and she's got a lot to give
Yes we're all cousins, that's what I believe
Because we're children of Adam and Eve
I got a girl and she wants a lot of love
That's the kind of trouble I need plenty of
But we'll be kissing cousins and that'll make it all right
We'll be Kissing cousins that'll make it all right
We'll be kissing cousins that's what makes it all right
I see a change as come in to our lives
It's not the way that it used to be
And it's not too late to realize our mistake
We're just not right for each other
Love has slipped away left us only friends
We almost seem like strangers
All that's left between us are the memories we share
Of times we thought we cared for each other
There's nothing left to do but go our separate ways
And pick up all the pieces left behind us
And maybe someday, somewhere along the way
Another love will find us
Some day when she's older, maybe she will understand
Why her mom and dad are not together
The tears that she will cry when I have to say goodbye
Will tear at my heart forever
Pick up all the pieces left behind us
Wow wow woa wow,                                                                       Wow wow woa wow,                                                                       Wow wow woa wow
Wow wow woa wow
You may ask me how I know
My Lord is real (My Lord is real)
You may doubt the things I say
And doubt the way I feel (the way I feel)
But I know he's real today
He'll always be (He'll always be)
I can feel his hand in mine
And that's enough for me
I will never walk alone
He holds my hand (He holds my hand)
He will guide each step I take
And if I fall I know he'll understand
Till the day he tells me why
He loves me so (he loves me so)
That's all I need to know
Gonna tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John
He claim he got married, but he havin' lotsa fun
Oh baby, yeah baby
Whoo baby, havin' me some fun tonight
Well, long tall Sally she built for speed
She got everything that Uncle John needs
Ooh baby, havin' me some fun tonight
Well, I saw uncle John with bald-headed Sally
He saw Aunt Mary comin' and he ducked back in the alley
Well, long tall Sally she's built sweet(5233508)
Whoo baby, havin' me some fun tonight, go
I'm gonna have some fun tonight
Have some fun tonight
Everything's alright
Have some fun, have me some fun tonight
Kauai, island of love
Lovely princess of the islands
Listen, can't you hear her calling
Aloha welcome my love
Her palm trees gently do the hula
While her slaves, the waves
Rush in to kiss her shores
Heaven is another name for
I said see, see, see rider
Oh, see what you have done
Oh girl, you made me love you
Now, now, now your loving man has gone
Hear what I say
Well, I'm going away, baby
And I won't be back till fall
Well, I'm going away baby
And if I find me a good girl
I won't, I won't be back at all
Hear what I say, I said
See see rider
Oh see what you have done
Born in the heat of the desert
My mother died giving me life
Deprived of the love of a father
Blamed for the loss of his wife
You know Lord I've been in a prison
For something that I never done
It's been one hill after another
I've climbed them all one by one
But this time, Lord you gave me a mountain
A mountain I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time
My woman got tired of the heartaches
Tired of the grief and the strife
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife
She took my one ray of sunshine
She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy
Ooooh
So close, yet so far from paradise
I hold you in my arms, in paradise
Is mine, then you slip away
Like a child at play, and here am I
When you are close to me, it's paradise
We kiss, oh my love, paradise
Is mine, then suddenly you're gone from me
Like a floating star, I see, and here am I
I reach out for you, but each time I do
I always find you gone
I know love is new, I'll take care of you
In my arms is where you belong
Just a step away, are we from paradise
Take my hand, come away, to paradise
My love, I want you close to me
I need you desperately, oh here am I
Waiting for you
Here am I
Praying for you
Here am I, so close, yet so far from paradise
Lying by your side I watch you sleeping
And in your face the sweetness of a child
Murmuring the dreams you won't recapture
Though it will haunt the corners of you mind
Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling
Who can tell when summer turns to autumn
And who can point the moment love grows cold
Softly without pain the joy is over
Though why it's gone will neither of us know
But reason can't stand in for feeling, oh
Six o'clock the baby will be crying
And you will stumble, sleeping to the door
In the chill and solemn gray of morning
We play the parts that we have learned too well
I've lost you yes, I've lost you
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Just pretend that we're together all alone
Tell the man to turn the juke box way down low
You can tell your friend there with you, he'll have to go
You can't say the words I want to hear
When you're with another man
If you love me, answer yes or no
Darling, I will understand
Just put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
And you can tell your friend there with you, he'll have to go
Yes you can tell your friend there with you, he'll have to go
I am just a lonesome cowboy
And I'm travelling all alone
I ain't even got a nickel
To call my baby on the phone
Just beyond the mountain lies a city
And I hear it calling me
Saddle up and ride, you lonesome cowboy
Here is where you'll find your destiny (destiny)
In my dreams the lights shine bright and pretty
Near to me and yet so far
Will I always be a lonesome cowboy
Am I only reaching for a star?
(For a star, for a star, for a star)
Ride, ride, ride
(Ride along cowboy) Cowboy, cowboy
(Sing) Sing, sing, sing
(Sing a song cowboy) Cowboy, cowboy
Will I ever leave this lonesome valley
Really see the lights that shine (shine)
Got to find what lies beyond the mountain
Got to rope and tie that dream of mine
(Dream of mine, dream of mine, that dream of mine)
If you don't call me, baby
Then I'm never coming home
Then I ain't ever coming home
I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill when I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
It lingered until my dreams came true
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be
Though we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill
I gave my heart
I gave my love
Oh ho, my darling
I am true
Doing the best
The best I can
But it's not good enough for you
I tried so hard
So hard to please
What more can I do
You know I was the kind who'd run
Any time you'd call
I guess I was the only one
Who didn't mind at all
I'll be a dreamer
I'll be a fool
My whole life through
Let's go on a moonlight swim
Far away from the crowd
All alone upon the beach
Our lips and our arms
Close within each other's reach
Will be on a moonlight swim
To the raft we can race
After just a little while
I'll sit and pretend
That you're on a desert isle
With me on a moonlight swim
Though the air is cold
With kisses oh so sweet
I'll keep you warm
So very warm from head to your feet
We're in love and above
There's a crazy balloon
That sits winking down
And inviting us to come on in
On a moonlight swim
Till the lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
Well the bear will be gentle
Shall be lit by a child
Well you may run on for a long time
Run along for a long time
Run on for a long time
Let me tell you God almighty gonna cut you down
Go tell that long tongued liar, oh well well
Go tell that midnight rider, oh well well
Tell the gambler, the rambler, the back-biter
Tell them God almighty gonna cut 'em down
Stop God almighty let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dews
I've been down on my bended knees
Talking to the man from Galilee
My God spoke and he spoke so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of angel's feet
He put one hand upon my head
Great God almighty let me tell you what he said
You may throw your rock and hide your hand
Working in the dark against your fellow man
As sure as God made the day and the night
What you do in the dark will be brought to the light
You may run and hide, slip and slide
Trying to take the mote from your neighbor’s eye
As sure as God made the rich and poor
You going to reap just what you sow
Some people go to church just to sit in the fire
Trying to make a date with the neighbor’s wife
Brother let me tell you as sure as you're born
You better leave that woman alone
Because one of these days mark my word
You think that brother is going to work
And you'll sneak up and knock on that door
That's all brother you'll knock no more
Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
When my rainbow turns the clouds away
You'll be back within my arms to stay
When the memories that linger in our hearts
Memories that make my heart grow cold
Well, when someday they're gonna live again, sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold
Well, when the memories that linger in our hearts
When my rainbows turn the clouds away
You'll be back within my arms to stay (stay)
You came when I was happy in your sunshine
I grew to love you more each passing day
Before too long I'd filled my world around you
Yeah and I prayed you loved enough of me to stay
If you love me let me know
If you don't let me go
I can't take another minute of the day without you near
If you love me let it be
If you don't set me free
Take the chains away that keep me loving you
The arms that open wide to hold me closer
The hands that run their fingers through my hair
The smile that says hello it's good to see you
Any time I turn around and find you there
It's this and so much more that makes me love you
What else can I do to make you see
You know you'll have whatever's mine to give you
Yeah but a love affair for one it can never be
Silver bells, silver bells
Its Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there’s a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you’ll hear
Strings of streetlights, even stoplights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch
This is Santa’s big scene
And above all this bustle you’ll hear
I went and bought myself a ticket
And I sat down in the very first row
They pulled the curtain
But then when they turned the spotlight way down low
Little Egypt came out a-struttin'
Wearing nothin' but a button and a bow
Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying
Ying-ying, ying-ying
She had a ruby on her tummy
And a diamond big as Texas on her toe
She let her hair down
And she did the hoochie-coochie real slow
When she did her special number on the zebra skin
I thought she'd stop the show
She did her triple somersault and when she hit the ground
She winked at the audience and then she turned around
She had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine
Said, Phoenix, Arizona 1949
Yeah, but let me tell you people
Little Egypt doesn't dance there anymore
She's too busy mopping
And a-takin' care of shopping at the store
Cause we've got seven kids
And all day long they crawl around the floor
Oh yes, I've got a lot of living to do
A whole lot of loving to do
Come on, baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot of living to do
Whole lot of loving to do
Well, there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you
There's a moon that's big and bright
In the milky way tonight
But the way you act, you never would know it's there
Now baby, time's a-wasting
A lot of kisses I am not been tasting
I don't know about you, but I'm going to get my share
I got a lot of living to do
There's a balmy little breeze
That's a-whistling through the trees
And it's telling you to pitch a little woo with me
Why don't you take a listen
You'll never know what you've been missing
Cuddle up real close and be my little honey bee
Got a lot of living to do
Got a lotta loving to do
Whole lotta loving to do
You're the prettiest thing I've seen
But you treat me so doggone mean
Ain't you got no heart, I'm dying to hold you near
Why do you keep me waiting?
Why don't you start cooperating?
And the things I say, the things you want to hear
I got a lotta loving to do
There's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you
I'll be as strong as a mountain
Or weak as a willow tree
Any  way you want me
Well, that's how I will be
I'll be as tame as a baby
Or wild as the raging sea
Any way you want me
In your hands my heart is clay
To take and hold as you may
I'm what you make me, you've only to take me
And in your arms I will stay
I'll be a fool or a wise man
My darling, you hold the key
Yes, any way you want me
I will be
Suntanned, windblown
Honeymooners at last alone
Feeling far above par
Oh, how lucky we are
While I give to you and you give to me
True love, true love
So, on and on it will always be
For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothing to do
But to give to you and to give to me
Love forever true
I need somebody to lean on
I need somebody to, to tell my troubles to
No use denying, I'm close to crying
But what good, tell me, what good would my crying do?
I need somebody to help me
Help me forget all those worries on my mind
And when I'm lonely, if someone would only
Want to be sweet and kind
I need somebody, won't that somebody
Please, please listen to my plea?
Need that somebody, won't that somebody
Come running to me?
I'm tired of being unhappy and so blue
If she came I would hold her
'Cause I need that shoulder to lean on, yes, I really do
I need somebody and maybe that somebody is you
Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me
Then I don't care
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know
When we met
I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let
This fool rush in
And I don't care
 
Well, my baby don't stand no cheating, my babe
Well, my babe don't stand no cheating
She don't, she don't, she don't, oh, Lord
My babe, I know she loves me, my babe
Well, now my babe, I know she loves me, my babe
Yeah, my baby, I know she loves me, my babe
Well, my baby, I know she loves me
She don't do nothing but kiss and hug me
Oh my, my baby
(Oh baby)
Well, well, my babe, I know she loves
She don't, she don't, she don't
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
And if you say goodbye, if you ever even try
I'm gonna love you more and more every day
I'm gonna  love you more and more in every way
And if you ever say goodbye, if you ever even try
I'm gonna  tell my mama, tell my papa too
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna to do
If you ever say goodbye, if you ever even try
I'm gonna love you more and more in every way
And if ever you say goodbye, if you ever even cry
I'm going to tell my mama, tell my papa too
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna do
When you looked into my eyes
I stood there like I was hypnotized
You sent a feeling to my spine
A feelin' warm and smooth and fine
But all I could do was stand there paralyzed
When we kissed, ooh what a thrill
You took my hand and, ooh baby, what a chill
I felt like grabbing you real tight
Squeeze and squeeze with all my might
Oh yeah lucky me, I'm singing every day, ooh
Ever since that day you came my way, ooh
You made my life for me just one big happy game
I'm gay every morning, at night I'm still the same
Well, do you remember that wonderful time
You held my hand and swore that you'd be mine
In front of preacher you said "I do"
I couldn't say a word for thinking of you
All I could do was stand there paralyzed
Well child, do you remember that wonderful time
When you held my hand and swore that you'd be mine
In the twilight glow I see her
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dying ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages I remember
Someday when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Angel, with those angel eyes
Come and take this earth boy
Up to paradise
Angel, may I hold you tight?
Never kissed an angel
Let me kiss one tonight
If I said "I love you"
Would I be speaking out of turn?
I'm only human, but I'm willing to learn
Angel, make my wish come true
Let me be in heaven here on earth with you
Angel, never kissed an angel
They say you found somebody new
Whose love will always be true
I don't know what it is to be alone
That's why I dread to know you're gone
Oh, Judy, don't let our sweet love wither and die
Like flowers in the fall
Oh, Judy, don't you know
It's you I love most of all
Oh, please come back
I promise always to be true
Oh, Judy, there'll never be
Anyone else, dear, but you
Yes my baby left me
Never said a word
Was it something I done
Something that she heard?
My baby left me
My baby even left me
Now I stand at my window
Wring my hands and cry
I hate to lose that woman
Hate to say goodbye
You know she left me
Yes, she left me
Baby, one of these mornings
Lord, it won't be long
You'll look for me and
Baby, and daddy he'll be gone
[Hook}
Well hello there
My it's been a long long time
How am I doing
Oh well I guess I'm doing fine
It's been so long now and it seems that
It was only yesterday
Mm, ain't it funny how time slips away
How's your new love
I hope that he's doing fine
Heard you told him, yes baby
That you'd love him till the end of time
Well you know, that's the same thing
That you told me
Well it seems like just the other day
Got to go now
Guess I'll see you hanging round
Don't know when though, oh
Never know when I'll be back in town
But I remember what I told you
That in time you’re going to pay
Well ain't it surprising how time slips away
Yeah, ain't it surprising how time slips away
Oh oh, I love you so
Uh uh, can't let you go
Ooh ooh, don't tell me no
I need your love tonight
Oh gee, the way you kiss
Sweetie, too good to miss
Wow-whee, want more of this
I've been waiting just for tonight
To do some lovin' and hold you tight
Don't tell me baby you gotta go
I got the hi-fi high
and the lights down low
Hey now, hear what I say
Oh wow, you better stay
Pow pow, don't run away
I need your love tonight, yeah
You're not a dream, you're not an angel, you're a woman
I'm not a king, just a man, take my hand
We'll make a space in this lives that we planned
And here we'll stay until it's time for you to go
Yes, we're different worlds apart, we're not the same
We laughed and played at the start like in a game, oh Lord
You could have stayed outside my heart but in you came
And here you'll stay until it's time for you to go
Don't ask why
Don't ask how
Don't ask forever
Lord love me, love me, love me, love me now
This love of mine has no beginning, it has no end
I was an oak now I'm a willow and I can bend
And tho' I'll never in my life see you again
Here I stay until it's time for you to go
Oh yes, I'll stay until it's time for you to go
Where it began, I can't begin to knowin'
But then I know it's growing strong
Oh, was in the spring, (Whooo)
And spring became the summer
Who'd've believe you'd come along
Hands, touching hands, reaching out
Touching me, touching you
Oh, sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined to believe it never would
And now I, I look at the night (Whooo)
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two, oh
And when I hurt
Hurting runs off my shoulder
How can I hurt when holding you
One, touching one, reaching out
I've been inclined to believe they never would
Ohhh, sweet Caroline, good times never seemed so good
A water glass full of whiskey
And women that I never knew too well
Lord, the things I've seen and done
Most of which I'd be ashamed to tell
I don't know how it started
But that's what makes a man a man, I guess
Now I'm holding on to nothing
Trying' to forget the rest
I'm looking back on my life
To see if I can find the pieces
I know that some were stolen
And some just blew away
Well, I found the bad parts
Found all the sad parts
But I guess I threw the best part away
Lord away, away
Playin' the bars, playin' like a star
Anything to get a name
Carryin' on, livin' on songs
My friends wrote for me to sing
But I guess I threw the best parts away
Away, away
Lord, the pieces of my life
They're everywhere, they're everywhere
And the one I think I miss most of all
Is you and you know who
Looking back on my life Lord
Looking back on my life today
Looking back on my life
God help me find the pieces
Wherever you go
Wherever you may wonder in your life
Well surely you know, I always wanna be there
Holding your hand
And standing by to catch you when you fall
Seeing you through, in everything you do
I said let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
Let me take you to that wonderland that only two can share
All I ask you, is let me be there
Watching you grow
And going through the changes in your life
That's how I know, I always wanna to be there
Whenever you feel you need a friend to lean on
Here I am
Whenever you call, you know I'll be there
Let me be there in your morning
All I ask you is let me be there
I know I'd go from rags to riches
If you would only say you cared
And though my pockets may be empty
I'd be a millionaire
My clothes may still be torn and tattered
But in my heart I'd be a king
Your love is all that ever mattered
It's everything
So open your arms and you'll open the door
To all the treasure that I'm living for
Hold me and kiss me and tell me you're mine evermore
Must I forever stay a beggar
Whose golden dreams will not come true
Or will I go from rags to riches
My fate is up to you
I'm satisfied with just a cottage below
A little silver and a little gold
But in that city where the ransomed will shine
I want a gold one that's silver lined
I've got a mansion just over the hilltop
In that bright land where we'll never grow old
And some day yonder we will never more wander
But walk on streets that are purest gold
Don't think me poor or deserted or lonely
I'm not discouraged I'm heaven bound
I'm but a pilgrim in search of the city
I want a mansion, a harp and a crown
I've been in love so many times
I thought I knew the score
Now you've treated me so wrong
I can't take any more
And it looks like I'm never gonna fall in love again
Fall in love, I'm never gonna fall in love
I mean it, I mean it, fall in love again
I gave my heart so easily, cast aside my pride
When I saw you in his arms baby
I broke up and cried
That's what I'm saying Fall in love, No, I'm never gonna fall in love
Please don't make me fall in love again
That's why I, no, I'm never gonna fall in love
Please don't make me, don't make me, fall in love again
You may not mind that it's over
But I've a different point of view
Even though I am shattered
It's easy for you
You don't have to face the music
You don't have to face the crowd
Just go back where you came from
You ain't even proud
I had a wife and I had children
I threw them all away
And now you tell me, you dare to tell me
I should go back to them
What do you think I should say
I found it hard to leave them
Saddest thing I ever had to do
My problems haven't started
And it's easy for you
What do you think, what on earth do you think I should say
If you ever tire of the good life
Call me in a year or two
I've got no choice, I'll forgive you
'Cause it's easy for you
You only have to call me, it's easy for you
Who made the mountains, who made the trees
Who made the rivers flow to the sea
And who sends the rain when the earth is dry
Somebody bigger than you and I
Who made the flowers to bloom in the spring
Who made the song for the robins to sing
And who hung the moon and the stars in the sky
He lights the way when the road is long
He keeps you company
And with His love to guide you
He walks beside you
Just like He walks with me
When we're filled with despair
Who gives me courage to go from there
And who gives me faith that will never die
(words & music by robert higginbotham)
Put on your red dress baby 'cause we're going out tonight, oh yeah!
Put on your red dress baby 'cause we're going out tonight, yeah!
Well now wear some boxing gloves in case some fool might start a fight
You know what i'm sayin'
Put on your hi-heel sneakers, put your wig hat on your head, oh yeah!
Put on your hi-heel sneakers, slap that wig right on your head, yeah!
Well i'm pretty sure now baby, pretty soon you're gonna knock 'em dead
Oh gonna mess around baby
All right!
Da da da da etc
Walk around baby!
Da da da etc
All right take it home baby!
Lead me oh Lord, won't you lead me
I am tired and I need Thy strength and power
To guide me over my darkest hour
For just open my eyes that I may see
Lead me, guide me along the way
For if you lead me I cannot stray
Or just open my eyes that I may see
I am lost if you take your hand from me
I am blind without try light to see
Lord just always let me Thy servant be
Lord just open my eyes that I may see
Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning
When through the sleepy haze I see her lying there
Soft as the rain that falls on summer flowers
Warm as the sunlight shining on her head
When I awake and see her there so close beside me
I want to take her in my arms
The ache is there so deep inside me
Chasing the rainbow in her dreams so far away
And when she turns to touch me I kiss her face so softly
And then my Mary wakes to love and love again
And Mary's there in summer days or stormy weather
She doesn't care how right or wrong the love we share
We share together
Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the evening
Kissed by the shade of night and starlight in her hair
And as we walk, I hold her close beside me
All our tomorrows for a lifetime we will share
Baby let me be your lovin teddy bear
Oh let me be your teddy bear
I don't wanna be a tiger
Cause tigers play to rough
Cause lions ain't the kind
You love enough
I just wanna be your teddy bear
Baby let me be around you every night
Run your fingers though my hair
And cuddle me really tight
I'll never let you go, little darling
I'm so sorry 'cause I made you cry
I'll never let you go, 'cause I love you
So please don't ever say goodbye
The stars would tumble down beside me
The moon would hang its head and cry
My arms would never hold another baby doll
If we should ever say goodbye
Well, I'll never let you go
Because I love you, pretty baby
I'm so sorry 'cause I made you cry, I made you cry
Yeah, I'll never let you go
'Cause I love you, little baby
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glorious strains from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia
Christ the Saviour is born
You got the huggin'est arms
The thrillin'est eyes
You're just my style
And you're just the right size
Gonna stop
Uh, shopping around
I'm gonna stop
Shopping around cause I found
The girlie I'm looking for
Oh, the very first time
You touched my lips
Took my little red book
And tore it to bits
Ain't going to be
Searching no more
Ain't no other dolly I'm wanting to hold
Hey, hey, baby
I really am sold on you
Ooh, ooh, such a pretty little package
I never did see
Going to wrap you up and take you home with me
I'm thrilled like never before
Uh shopping around
There's a long line of mourners
Driving down our little street
Their fancy cars
Are such a sight to see, oh, yeah
They're all of your rich friends
Who knew you in the city
And now they've finally brought you
Brought you home to me
When you left, you know you told me
That some day you'd be returning
In a fancy car
All the town to see, oh, yeah
Well, now everyone is watching you
You finally had your dream
Yeah, and you're riding
(You're riding)
In a long black limousine
You know the papers told of how you lost your life, oh, yeah
The party, the party and the fatal crash that night
Well, the race upon the highway, oh, the curve you didn't see
Well, you're riding in that long black limousine
(You're riding in that long black limousine)
Through tear filled eyes I watch
As you ride by, oh, yeah
A chauffeur
A chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine
Well, I'll never, I'll never love another
Oh, my heart, all my dreams
Yeah, they're with you
In that long black limousine
Yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Well, I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my loving in the evening time
When I'm with my baby
Well, it ain't no fun with the sun around
I get going when the sun goes down
And I'm with my baby
Well, that's when we're going to kiss and kiss
And kiss And kiss
And we're going to kiss some more
Who cares how many times we kiss
'Cause at a time like this, who keeps score?
When I meet my baby
And kiss and kiss
And it don't matter if it's sleet or snow
The drive-in's cozy when the lights are low
Makes no difference if the rain comes down
I don't notice when she's around
Oh boy, what a baby
Well, one kiss from my baby doll
Makes me hot, more, more more more
And
We're going to kiss some more
Hawaiian sunset peeping from the sea
Smiles and says Aloha to his sweetheart Hawaii
The drowsy islands slumber one by one
Close their sleepy eyelids say goodnight to the sun
Then Hawaii like millions of times before
Blossoms in her lover's arms once more
Too soon the sunrise will wake her from her sleep
So until tomorrow, sleep Hawaii sleep
There's a ship lies rigged and ready in the harbor
Tomorrow for Old England she sails
Far away from your land of endless sunshine
To my land full of rainy skies and gales
And I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow
Though my heart is full of tears at this farewell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing
And the taste of war I know so very well
Even now I see that foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire as we sail into Hell
I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell
Though death and darkness gather all about me
And my ship be torn apart upon the seas
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
And the heaving waves that brought me once to thee
And should I return safe home again to England
I shall watch the English mist roll through the Dale
I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents for the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light leads
I'll be home for Christmas, oh yes
If only in my dreams
(I'll be home for Christmas)
What now my love
Now that you left me
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn into ashes
And all my hopes into bits of clay
Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I'm a numb
I've become unreal
I walk the night, oh, without a goal
Stripped of my heart, my soul
Now that it's over
I feel the world closing in on me
Here comes the stars
Tumbling around me
And there's the sky where the sea should be
Now that you're gone
I'd be a fool to go on and on
No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live or die
Now there is nothing
Only my last goodbye
When trouble is in my way
I can't tell the night from day
I toss from side to side
Like a ship on a raging tide
I don't worry and I don't fret
God has never failed me yet
Trouble's coming from time to time
But that's all right
Cause I'm not the worrying kind
Because I, I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know he's gonna fix it for me
Job was so sick so long
Till the flesh fell from his bones
His wife, cattle and children
Everything that he had was gone
But Job he never despaired
He knew that God still cared
Sleepless days and sleepless nights
Job said "Honey, that's all right"
Some folks wonder how I smile
Even though I'm going to trial
How can I have a song
Everything is going wrong
That's all right, I'm not the worrying kind
Cause I've got confidence
Lord, help me walk another mile, just one more mile
I'm tired of walking all alone
Lord, help me smile another smile, just one more smile
You know I just can't make it on my own
I never thought I needed help before
I thought that I could get by, by myself
But now I know I just can't take it any more
With a humble heart, on bended knee
I'm begging You, please, help me
Come down from your golden throne to me, to lowly me
I need to feel the touch of Your tender hand
Remove the chains of darkness let me see, Lord let me see
Just where I fit into Your master plan
I long to be His possession
Oh, He is my everything
I remember my days of darkness
Without sunshine or sight to lead the way
But a whisper of His voice softly calling
To the arms of my Maker to stay
He is my reason for living
Oh He is the king of all kings
After the lighting and thunder
After the last bell has rung
I want to bow down before Him
And hear Him say well done
Oh just because I asked a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I rang her number by mistake today
You know she thinks I, I still care
And just because I haunt the same old places
With a memory I will linger everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be
Lord, you know, she thinks I still care
Well, if she's happy thinking I still need her
Yeah, let that silly notion bring her cheer
Oh how could she ever be so foolish
Tell me where did she get, lord such an idea
Yeah, oh lord
Just because I asked a friend about her
And you know, just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because, lord I saw her and went to pieces
Lord, you know, she thinks I, lord, still care
You know, she thinks I, I still care
Lord, she thinks I still care
Oh no she thinks I still care
I said come on over baby
A-whole lot of shaking going on
Yeah I said come on over baby
Well we ain't faking
Mm, I said come on over baby
We got chicken in the barn
Whose barn, what barn, my barn
Come on over baby
We got the bull by the horns
Yeah, we ain't faking
Well, I said shake baby, shake
I said shake, baby shake now
I said shake it baby, shake it
I said shake it baby, shake
We ain't faking
Well, I said come on over baby
A-whole lot-ta shaking going on
Well my mom-mom-mom
I said shake it baby, shake all right
Holy smoke
And sakes alive!
I never thought this could happen to me
Uh huh, yeah
I got stung by a sweet honey bee
Oh, what a feeling come over me
It started in my eyes
Crept up to my head
Flew to my heart
Till I was stung dead
I'm done, uh-uh
I got stung
She had all that I wanted and more
And I've seen honey bees before
She started buzzing in my ear
Buzzing in my brain
Got stung all over
But I feel no pain
Now don't think I'm complaining
I'm mighty pleased we met
Because you give me just one little peck
On the back of my neck
And I break out in a cold, cold sweat
If I live to a hundred and two
I won't let nobody sting me but you
I'll be buzzing around your hive
Every day at five
And I'm never going to leave once I arrive
Because I'm done
Uh-uh, I got stung
Girls, going swimming, girls, in bikinis
A walking and wiggling by, yay, yay, yay
Girls, on the beaches, girls, oh, what a peaches
So pretty, Lord I could cry, I'm just a red blooded boy
And I can't stop thinking about
Girls, sailing sailboats, girls, water skiing
They'll drive me out of my mind, yay, yay, yay
Girls, big and brassy, girls, small and sassy
Just give me one of each kind
I'm just a red blooded boy
Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls!
And when I pick up a sandwich to munch
A crunchy crunchety, a crunchety crunch
I never ever get to finish my lunch
Because there's always bound to be a bunch of
Girls, in tight sweaters, girls, in short dresses
Girls, out boating, girls, just a floating
So pretty, Lord I could cry
I had to leave town for a little while
You said, you'd be good while I'm gone
But the look in your eye done told me you told a lie
I know there's been some carrying on
Baby, you're wearing that loved on look
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
The ash trays are all full of ashes
The floor needs a touch of the mop
There's a man downstairs with-a long bushy hair
He said your party was a three day romp
Baby, if you ever loved me
Then Bonnie and Clyde loved the law
And a bird can't fly and I don't like apple pie
And trees won't grow in Arkansas
Well, I know there's been some carrying on
Shoop, shoop
Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
Haven't ever lost one minute of sleeping
Worried about the way things might have been
A big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on b-b-b-burning
Rolling, Rolling, Rollin on a river
Rollin, Rollin, Rollin on a river
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of 'pane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen
If you come down to the river
I betcha you're going to find some people who live
You don't have to worry
Because you have no money
People along the river are happy to give
A little bird, he told me so
He said come on, get on the go
Open your eyes the sky is full of butterflies
The blossoms on the trees stir up the honey bees
Spring makes my fever right
Spring fever, Spring is here at last
Spring fever, my heart's beating fast
Get up, get out spring is everywhere
Well if you feel the wanderlust
Just grab a car or hop a bus
In every town there's excitement to be found
So much is happening
Don't miss the joy of spring
The world's in love just look around
Spring fever comes to everyone
Spring fever, it's time for fun
Spring fever, it's Spring fever time
Spring fever, watch that fever climb
Spring is everywhere
There was a man, a lonely man
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared that went unshared
Until it died within his silence
And Solitaire is the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing Solitaire
And keeping to himself begins to deal
And still the King of Hearts is well concealed
Another losing game comes to an end
And deals them out again
A little hope goes up in smoke
Just how it goes, goes without saying
Who would command the hand he's playing
Life goes on around him everywhere
Blue Spanish eyes teardrops are falling from your Spanish eyes
Please please don't cry, this is just adios and not good-bye
Soon I'll return, bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say "Si Si" say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
Summer kisses, winter tears
That was what she gave to me
Never thought I'd travel all alone
The trail of memories
Happy hours, lonely years
But I guess I can't complain
For I still recall the summer sun
Through all the winter rain
The fire of love, the fire of love
Can burn from afar
And nothing can light the dark of the night
Like a falling star
Like the stars they fade away
Leaving me to spend my lonely nights
With dreams of yesterday
Fools fall in in love in a hurry
Fools give their hearts much too soon
Just put in two bars of "Stardust"
Just hang out one silly moon
Oh, they've got their love torches burning
When they should be playing it cool
I used to laugh but now I'm the same
Take a look at a brand new fool
Fools fall in love just like schoolgirls
Blinded by rose colored dreams
They build their castles on wishes
With only rainbows for beams
Oh, they're making plans for the future
When they should be right back in school
Take a look at a brand new fool, all right
They've got their love torches burning
Hey mama, don't you treat me wrong
Come and love your daddy all night long
All right, hey, hey, all right now
See the girl with the diamond ring
She knows how to shake that thing
All right, hey, hey, Mm, all right now
Ah, Oh, Ah, Oh, Ah, Oh, Oh
Make me feel so good, make me feel so good right now
Make me feel so good, make me feel so good
Mm, see the girl with the red dress on
She can do the dog all night long
All right, hmm what'd I say, tell me what'd I say
Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say right now
Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say
It's all right, It's all right right now
Baby, it's all right, Baby, it's all right right now
Baby, it's all right, Oh yeah!
Baby shake that thing, baby shake that thing right now
Baby shake that thing, well I feel all right
Soldier boy, why feel blue?
Don't you believe that she will be true?
It's written in the book
That she was meant for only you
Soldier boy, tell me why do you cry?
When you return, she'll rush to your side
So prove your love is true
She'll be there to say, "I do"
And if you go sea or land
She'll make you understand
While you're gone, oh, try to believe
Her love for you is really for real
Soldier Boy
Why don't you swing down sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down chariot
Rock me lord, rock me lord
Calm and easy
Well I got a home on the other side
Well, well, well, well, well, well
Ezekiel went down in the middle of a field
He saw an angel working on a chariot wheel
Wasn't so particular 'bout the chariot wheel
Just wanted to see how a chariot feel
Well, well, well
Ezekiel went down and he got on board
Chariot went a bumping on down the road
Zeke wasn't so particular 'bout the bumping of the road
Just wanted to lay down his heavy load
Well I got a father in the promised land
Ain't no more stopping till I shake his hand
I got a home on the other side
Let's snap our fingers, clap our hands
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside, down by the riverside
Let's give 'em what the song demands
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside
We'll hear them playing, keep that beat
Let's get together, what a treat
Strike up the band. Start the parade
Don't let that grand old rhythm fade
Just play that song, play that number
When the saints come marching in
Shake tambourines. Play that cornet
That trumpet horn you won't forget
Your heart will hum to that number
The cymbals clang. Just pound that beat
Sounds like a hundred marching feet
It's fun to join in that number
See banners wave. Oh hear that ring
We all feel prouder than a king
'cos everyone, everyone loves that number
Frankie and me, we were lovers
Oh lordy how we did love
Swore we'd be true to each other
Just as true as stars above
I was her man, she caught me doing her wrong
My luck in poker was fading
When a new gal caught my eye
I gambled, I tried to change my luck
With a chick named Nellie Bly
I was Frankie's man but I was doing her wrong
Yeah! Frankie came looking to find me
Yes, she wasn't looking for fun
For in her sweet loving hand
She was toting' a .44 gun
To shoot her man if he was doing' her wrong
Well Frankie looked into the bar room
And right there in front of her eyes
There was her loving Johnny
Making love to that Nellie Bly
Frankie, I beg, please don't shoot me
Well they'll put you away in a cell
You know they'll put you where the cold wind blows
From the hottest corner of hell
I'm your man, I know I done you wrong
Easy roll me over, real easy
Easy roll me over, real slow
Roll me over real gently
Cause my wound hurts me so
Well I was her man
Well I done her wrong
Well Frankie told Johnny
Well this is the end of my song
I was her man, well I done her wrong
Well , hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Done her wrong
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
Oh well I know
If I'd arrived in time to know you
If you had taken the time to show me
I wouldn't be lonely
Where will I go
Who will I have to lie beside me
To ease this emptiness inside me
I'm so lonely
Tried so hard each time, each time I just can't make it
Feelin' fast vibrations and I just can't take it
Living from day to day, chasing the dream
I'm, I'm leavin'
It's a lonely man
Who wanders all around
Who roams from town to town
Searching, always searching
For something he can't find
Hoping, always hoping
That someday fate will be kind
Who travels all alone
When he has no one
That he can call his own
Always so unhappy
Taking shelter where he can
Come meet a lonely, lonely man
I memorize the note you sent
Go all the places that we went
I seem to search the whole day through
For anything that's part of you
I kept a ribbon from your hair
A breath of perfume lingers there
It helps to cheer me when I'm blue
Anything that's part of you
Oh, how it hurts to miss you so
When I know you don't love me anymore
To go on needing you
Knowing you don't need me
No reason left for me to live
What can I take, what can I give
When I'd give all of someone new
Every man, has a flaming star
A flaming star, over his shoulder
And when a man, sees his flaming star
He knows his time, his time has come
Flaming star, don't shine on me, flaming star
Flaming star, keep behind me, flaming star
There's a lot of living I've got to do
Give me time to make a few dreams come true
Flaming star
When I ride, I feel that flaming star
That flaming star, over my shoulder
And so I ride, front of that flaming star
Never looking around, never looking around
One fine day, I'll see that flaming star
And when I see, that old flaming star
I'll know my time, my time has come
Oh break it, burn it, drag it all around
Twist it, turn it, you can't tear it down
Cos' every minute, every hour you'll be shaken
By the strength and mighty power of my love
Crush it, kick it, you can never win
I know baby you can't lick it
I'll make you give in
Every minute, every hour you'll be shaken
Baby I want you, you'll never get away
My love will haunt you yes haunt you night and day
Touch it, pound it, what good does it do
There's just no stopping' the way I feel for you
Yeh, yeh, baby I want you, you'll never get away
I said every minute, every hour you'll be shaken
My baby's long and tall
She like a cannonball
Say, every time she loves me
Lordy, you can hear me squall
She cried, "Ooh-wee
I believe I'll change my mind"
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"
My baby knows just how
To treat me right
Gives me plenty loving
Morning, noon and night
When my baby does
What she does to me
I climb the highest mountain
Dive in the deepest sea
My baby's lips are red
And sweet like wine
And when she kisses me
I get high every time
Is your burden heavy as you bear it all alone?
Does the road you travel, harbor dangers yet unknown?
Are you growing weary in the struggle of it all?
Jesus will help you with all his name you call
He's always there hearing every prayer, faithful and true
Walking by our side, in his love we hide all the day through
When you get discouraged just remember what to do
Reach out to Jesus, he's reaching out to you
Is the life you're living filled with sorrow and despair?
Does the future press you with its worry and its scare?
Are you tired and jealous, have you almost lost your way?
Jesus will help you, just talk to him today
Oh, if you tell a lie
You know that I'll forgive you
Though you say our love is just a game
And when you hear my name
You'll say I'm from a strange world
But is it so strange to be in love with you
Is it so strange
That I love you more than all the world
I have no eyes for any other girl
Oh, won't you take me back
And say that you still love me
To waste a love like ours would be a sin
Let us kiss again
Let me hold you near
And take me from this strange world
That I'm living in
An angel sent from above, is Mama
And everyone fell in love, with Mama
Mama's so sweet, Mama's so nice
If there is trouble take Mama's advice
There's no-one I hold so dear, as Mama
I always want to be near
Mama
I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog sitting on a hollow stump
I've got so many women I don't know which way to jump
I said flip flop and fly I don't care if I die
I won't ever leave Don't ever say goodbye
I am the king of the jungle
They call me Tiger Man
If you cross my path
You take your own life in your hands
Yeah, I get up on a mountain
And I call my bear cat back
My bear cat comes running
And the hound dogs they stay way back
Way back, way back, way back
Trace their way back
Yeah, well, I get up on a mountain
But the hound dogs trace their way back
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
Jericho Jericho
And the walls come tumbling down
God knows that
Good morning sister Mary
Good morning brother John
Well I wanna stop and talk with you
Wanna tell you how I come along
I know you've heard about Joshua
He was the son of Nun
He never stopped his work until
Until the work was done
You may talk about your men of Gideon
You may brag about your men of Saul
There's none like good old Joshua
At the battle of Jericho
Up to the walls of Jericho
He marched with spear in hand
Go blow them ram horns, Joshua cried
Cause the battle is in my hands
You may brag about your king of Saul
There none like Joshua
They tell me, great God that Joshua's spear
Was well nigh twelve feet long
And upon his hip was a double edged sword
And his mouth was a gospel horn
Yet bold and brave he stood
Salvation in his hand
Go blow them ram horns Joshua cried
Cause the devil can't do you no harm
Then the lamb ram sheep horns began to blow
The trumpets began to sound
Old Joshua shouted glory
And the walls came tumbling down
Down, down, down, down, down
Tumbling down
Please don't stop loving me
You were born just to be in my arms
In my arms
Your lips were made just to be kissed by me
Kissed by me
When I'm with you
I don't know day from night, wrong from right
You are my world, that's all I know
I love you so, I won't let go
Darling you'll always be mine alone
Mine alone
Ooh, love, a thing called love
Six foot six he stood on the ground, he weighed 235 pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love
He was the kind of a man who would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love
You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of many man, this thing called love
It can lift you up, never let you down
Take your world and turn it all around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found that's stronger than love
Most men are like me they struggle and doubt
Trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with living to worry about a little word like love
But when I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I thank God that the world's been blessed
With a thing called love
Well, you're right, I'm left, she's gone
You're right, and I'm left all alone
Well, you tried to tell me so
But how was I to know
That she was not the one for me?
You told me all along
You're right, our love was so wrong
But now I changed my mind
Because she broke the ties that bind
And I know that she never cared for me
Well, I thought I knew just what she'd do
I guess I'm not so smart
Oh, you tried to tell me along
She'd only break my heart
I'm left, you're right, she's gone
Well, she's gone I know not where
But now I just don't care
For now I'm falling for you
If you'll forgive me now
I'll make it up somehow
So happy we will be
In a home just for three
And I'll soon forget her
Now I know
You tried to tell me all along
Well, she's gone, I know not where
For now I've fallen for you
But now after loving you
What else is there to do?
For honey, all the rest
Is just gonna have to be second best
I know I'll go through life
Comparing her to you
That's cause I'm no good
I'm no good to anyone
After loving you
Your precious love cannot be erased
By just another woman with a pretty face
And your memory, you know it will remain
For it cannot be erased
Other loves may come along
They can't live up to you
I said I'm no good
I'm no good
To anyone, to anyone, to anyone
I'm no good to anyone after loving you
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything
I hear footsteps slowly walking
As they gently walk across the lonely floor
And a voice is softly saying
Darling this will be goodbye for evermore
There goes my reason for living
There goes the one of my dreams
As my memory turns back the pages
I can see the happy years we've had before
Now the love that kept this old heart beating
Has been shattered by the closing of the door
When they gave out eyes like diamonds
That would shame the stars that shine
My darling, my darling
You were the first in line
When they gave out lips like honey
That hold a new thrill every time
There may be others that know you longer
Who pledge their hearts to you
But there's no other could love you stronger
Any stronger than I do
Don't refuse me, say you'll choose me
I'm yours, oh please be mine
My darling, say I'm your darling
The first and the last in line
Little sister, don't you, little sister, don't you
Then say it's very nice and then you run
Little sister, don't you do what your big sister done
Well, I dated your big sister, then took her to a show
I went for some candy, along came Jim Dandy
Hey, get back, hey, get back
Hey, get back to where you once belonged
Hey, get back to where you once belonged, yeah
Hey, get back, back
Get back to where you once belonged, yeah
Merry, merry Christmas, baby
Sure did treat me nice
I said merry Christmas, baby
Gave me diamond rings for Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I want to kiss you, baby
While you're standing 'neath the mistletoe
I said, merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice, yes, you did
Yes, you did, yes, you did, yes, you did
I said merry, merry Christmas baby
I said, merry, merry, merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice
I said, merry, merry Christmas, baby
Girl, you sure did treat me nice
Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
Now I'm putting it through Al's mike
Got good music on my, on my radio
Underneath your mistletoe
Ito eat like teeth are out of style
Ito eating all the while
Eat Ito eat all the night and the day
Ito is an eating boy
He never get enough from fish and poi
He eat everything he don't care what
He even eat the shell from the coconut
Hey, Ito little faster
Ito little slower
When you say that strangers smile
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't want my heart to be broken
'Cause it's the only one I've got
So darling, please be careful
You know I care a lot
Darling, please don't break my heart
I beg of you
I don't want no tears a-falling
You know I hate to cry
But that's what's bound to happen
If you would say goodbye
Darling, please don't say goodbye
Hold my hand and promise
That you'll always love me true
Make me know you'll love me
The same way I love you, little girl
You got me at your mercy
Now that I'm in love with you
So please don't take advantage
Because you know my love is true
Darling, please please love me too
'Cause you know my love is true
Ready, set, go man go
I got a gal that I love so
I'm ready, ready ready ready
I'm ready, ready ready teddy
I'm ready ready ready to rock'n'roll
Going down to the corner
Pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock'n'roll baby
She's the apple of my eye
Flat top cats and the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint is really jumping, the cats are going wild
The music really sends me, I dig that crazy style
The joint's really jumping, the cats are going wild
The music really sends me, dig that crazy style
Gonna kick off my shoes, roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock'n'roll baby, pour on the steam
I shuffle to the left, shuffle to the right
Gonna rock'n'roll till the early early light
When I think of how he came so far from glory
Came to dwell among the lowly such as I
To suffer shame and such disgrace
On Mount Calvary take my place
Then I ask myself this question
Who am I?
Who am I that the King would bleed and die for
Who am I that he would pray not my will, Thy Lord
The answer I may never know
Why he ever loved me so
But to an old rugged cross he'd go
For who am I?
When I'm reminded of his words
I'll leave him never
If you'll be true I'll give to you life forever
Oh I wonder what I could have done
To deserve God's only son
To fight my battles until they're won
But to an old rugged cross he'd go for, who am I?
Maybe it's too late
Sometimes even hate myself
For loving you
Trying to be strong
Then night time comes along
And I start loving you, wanting you
Where is all my self control?
I'm burning way down in my soul
And needing you
Wishing I could be the man I try to
Hating me for wanting to be with you
Knowing you don't love me like you used to
But it's midnight, oh, and I miss you
It's getting late and I know
That's when I am weak
Funny how things have a way
Of looking so much brighter in the daylight
I hope to go to bed
And try to straighten out my head
And just forget you
Oh, but it's midnight and I miss you
It's midnight and I miss you
Feel so bad
Like a ball game on a rainy day
Yes I got my rain check
Shake my head and walk away
Oooo-people that's the way I feel
Sometimes I think I want
Then again I think I don't
Sometimes I want to stay here
Then again I want to leave here
Then again I want to stay
Yes, I got my train fare
Pack my grip and ride away
Whether I'm riding down a highway
Or walking down a street
It makes no difference, baby
I'm gonna love you just as mean
'Cause holding your little hand
Makes me feel so very nice
Anyplace is paradise
Whether we're standing on a doorstep
Or sitting at a park
Or strolling down a shady lane
Or dancing in the dark
Well, I can take you in my arms
And look into your pretty eyes
Give me a cave up in the mountains
Or a shack down by the sea
And I will be in heaven, honey
If you are there with me
Well, kiss your pretty lips
See the love light in your eyes
Baby, I'd live deep in the jungle
And sleep up in a tree
And let the rest of the world go by
If you were there with me
Well, I could love you all the time
Baby, the jungle would be fine
Won't you wear my ring around your neck
To tell the world I'm yours, by heck
Let them see your love for me
And let them see by the ring around your neck
Let them know I love you so
And let them know by the ring around your neck
Well, they say that going steady is not the proper thing
They say that we're too young to know the meaning of a ring
I only know I love, love you and that you love me too
So, darling, please do what I ask of you
So, darling, this is what I beg of you
(Santa bring my baby back to me)
I don't need a lot of presents
To make my Christmas bright
I just need my baby's arms
Wound around me tight
Oh Santa, hear my plea
Santa, bring my baby back to me
The Christmas tree is ready
The candles all aglow
But with my baby far away
What good is mistletoe
Santa bring my baby back to me
Please make these reindeer hurry
Well their time is drawing near
It sure won't seem like Christmas
Until my baby's here
Fill my sock with candy
And a bright and shiny toy
You wanna make me happy
And fill my heart with joy
Then Santa, hear my plea
I said I'd hold, I said I'd hold
I said I'd hold you in my heart 'till I can hold you in my arms
Like you've never been held before
Well I'll think of you each day and then I'll dream the night away
Oh, 'till you are in my arms once more
The stars up in the sky, you know they know the reason why
I feel so blue cause I'm away from you
Yeah I'll hold you in my heart 'till I can hold you in my arms
Oh darling please wait for me
You know the stars up in the sky, you know they know the reason why
I feel so blue cause I'm away, I'm away from you
The stars up in the sky you know they know the reason why...
I feel so blue cause I'm away, I'm away, I'm away, I'm away from you
I said, I said I'd hold you in my heart, heart, heart 'till I can hold you in my arms
I, I feel so blue cause I'm away, I'm away from you
Yeah, I'll hold you in my heart 'till I can hold you in my arms
If I could be you, if you could be me
For just one hour
If we could find a way to get inside
Each other's mind
If you could see you through my eyes
Instead of your ego
I believe you'd be, I believe you'd be surprised to see
That you've been blind
Walk a mile in my shoes
Yeah, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Now if we spend the day
Throwing stones at one another
'Cause I don't think,  'cause I don't think I wear my hair the same way you do
Well, I may be common people
But I'm your brother
When you strike out
To try to hurt me
It's hurtin' you
Now there are people on reservations
And out in the ghetto
And brother there, but for the grace of god
Go you and me
If I only had the wings
Of a little angel
Don't you know, I'd fly to the top of a mountain
And then I'd cry, cry, cry
You give your hand to me
And then you say hello
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
But you don't know me
No, you don't know the one
Who thinks of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips
And longs to hold you tight
To you I am just a friend
And that's all I've ever been
No, you don't know me
For I never knew the art of making love
No, my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
The chance that you might love me too
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
To never, never know
The one who loves you so
Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
The summer's gone and all the roses dying
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bye
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
And I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so
But if he come and all the roses dying
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
He'll come here and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an Ave there for me
And I shall feel, oh soft you tread above me
And then my grave will richer, sweeter be
For you will bend and tell me that you love me
And I shall rest in peace until you come to me
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Can't you hear me when I call?
Well you ain't so big, you know you just tall that's all, All right
Well you got me working, boss man
Working round the clock
I want to little drink of water
But you won't let big Al stop
Big boss man, now can't you hear me when I call? All right
I said you ain't so big, you know you just tall that's all
Big boss man, why can't you hear me when I call? All right
You know you ain't not so big, I said you just tall that's all, All right
I'm going to get me a boss man
The one who's going to treat me right
I work hard in the day time
Rest easy at night
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call? Can't you hear me when I call?
I said you ain't so big, you just tall that's all
One that's going to treat me right
I work hard in the evening
Big boss man, big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
All right, big boss man
It's all right
When a boy like me meets a girl like you
Then I must believe wishes come true
I just look at you and I touch your hand
And this ordinary world becomes a wonderland
There are many girls I have met before
But I pass them by because I knew
There would be this magic moment
One to last a lifetime through
Her eyes tell the story so well
She tries hard to hide
So little expected
Too often neglected
A woman stripped of her pride
Always so careful not to cry
Until I fall asleep
And there in the silence
She lies with a tear on her cheek
The thought comes to mind
That I've failed somehow
For things I can't quite recall
A man without love is only half a man
But a woman is nothing at all
She knows I don't love her
Although Heaven knows I've tried
Her reason for living
Is to go right on giving
The one thing that she's been denied
Without any warning
In the wee hours of the morning
She cries
The hurt deep inside she tries so to hide
Is beginning to show in her eyes
And a thought comes to mind that I've relive sometimes
For here it I can't quite recall
That a man without love's only half a man
Yeah, a man without love's only half a man
Hey Jude, don't be a fool
Take a sad song and make it better
The minute you let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Hey Jude, don't let me down
Let it out and let in
Hey Jude begin
To making the world a little better
Don't you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
In making the world a little better
Na na na na na na na
Take off your shoes, put down your hair
Turn on the music, and we'll get somewhere
Dance, dance, dance, till you toes get tan
We're gonna to have us a ball on the beach
A-slicing sand
Hug me a heap, swing me a lot
We got a lot of ocean if it gets too hot
O-o-o, o-o-o, baby, take my hand
We'll have some real rocking fun in the sun
Come baby, come, let's dig some holes
You'll find it's heaven with sand on your soles
Slice through to the left, slice to the right
Slice down the middle, baby, hold me tight
O-o-o wee, o-o-o, baby, hold my hand
Slicing sand
Ooo yeah
Salesman talking to me tried to run me up a creek
Says you can buy it, go on try it, you can pay me next week
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Oh-ho-ho
Blonde haired, good looking trying to get me hooked
Wants me to marry, settle down and get a home and and write a book
Pay phone, something wrong, dial gone
Well me ought to sue the operator for telling me a tale
Oh-ho-ho  Oh-ho-ho  Oh-ho-ho  Oh-ho-ho
Been to Vietnam, been a fighting in the war
Army bar, army chow, army clothes, army car
Working in the filling station, too many tasks
Wipe the window, check the tires, check the oil, dollar gas
Wants me to marry, get a home, settle down and and write a book
Too much monkey business, Oh-ho-ho, too much monkey business, Oh-ho-ho
Too much monkey business, Oh-ho-ho too much monkey business, Oh-ho-ho
I need you so (I need you so)
To keep me happy
If I can't have you
I cannot go on (I can't go on)
I need your arms (I need your arms)
Around me tightly
Yes, I miss them nightly
When you're not at home (you're not at home)
When the day is done
I miss you so
I lie and wait
To hear you knock upon the door (knock upon the door)
When you leave me (when you leave me)
I try not to worry
Come back in a hurry (please, please come back)
'Cause I need you so (I need you so)
I walk along a thin line, darling
Dark shadows follow me
Here's where life's dream lies disillusioned
The edge of reality
Oh, I can hear strange voices echo
Laughing with mockery
The border line of doom I'm facing
On the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me
The girl with the nameless face
On the edge of reality where she overpowers me
With fears that I can't explain
She drove me to the point of madness
The brink of misery
If she's not real then I'm condemned to
Reality, reality, reality, reality
He left the splendor of heaven
Knowing His destiny
Was the lonely hill of Golgotha
There to lay down His life for me
And if that isn't love
Then the ocean is dry
There's no stars in the sky
And the little sparrows can't fly
Yeah if that isn't love
Then heaven's a myth
There's no feeling like this
If that isn't love
Even in death He remembered
The thief hanging by His side
Then he spoke of love and compassion
And He took him to paradise
It's got to be love
Oh how many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
How many, oh how many, I wonder
But I really don't want, I don't want to know
Oh how many lips have kissed you
And set, set your soul aglow, yes they did
How many, oh how many, I wonder, yes I do
But I really don't want to know
So always make, make me wonder
And always make, make me guess
And even, you know even if I ask you
Oh darling oh don't you, don't confess
Just let it, let it remain your secret
Oh for darling, darling I love you so
No wonder, yeah no wonder, I wonder
Mm, 'cause I really don't want, I don't want to know
O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight
For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth
And praises sing to God the king and peace to men on earth
Follow that dream, I got to follow that dream
Keep a-moving, move along, keep a moving
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need
When your heart gets restless, time to move along
When your heart gets weary, time to sing a song
But when a dream is calling you
There's just one thing that you can do
Well, you got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
You got to follow that dream to find the love you need
Got to find me someone whose heart is free
Someone to look for my dream with me
And when I find her I may find out
Just what my dreams are all about
Keep a-moving, move along
As I walk along, I wonder
What went wrong with our love
Our love that was so strong
And as I still walk by
I think off the times we've had together
While our hearts were young
I'm a-walking in the rain
Hear it falling and I feel the pain
Wishing you were here by me
To end this misery
And I wonder
(I, I, I, I wonder)
Yo, baby
Why?
(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)
You went away
And I wonder where you will stay
My little runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway
You went away and I wonder where you will stay
The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the empty skies my love
To the dark and the empty skies
The first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands
Like a trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command my love
That was there at my command
Hoa hoa hoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Woh oh oh oh hoa hoa hoa
Oh hoa hoa hoa hoa hoa hoa
The way she held your hand
The little things you planned
Her memory is with you yet
That's someone you never forget
When she is far away
You'll think of her each day
And you know she'll wait for you
Others may pass your way
And let you think their love is true
But you know that they'll never replace
The one that waits for you
They call your daddy Big Boots
And Big Boots is his name
It takes a big man to wear big boots
That's your daddy's claim to fame
They know your daddy Big Boots
Wherever soldiers are
Cause he can handle an armored tank
Just like a kiddy car
So sleep little soldier
Loo loo loo loo
Loo loo loo
General sandman's soon coming by
I'm gonna tell you a little secret
You won't believe it's true
Did you know your
Daddy Big Boots
Once wore little boots like you
Vening shadows make me blue
When each weary day is through
How I long to be with you
My happiness
Every day I reminisce
Dreaming of your tender kiss
Always thinking how I miss
A million years it seems
Have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again
There'll be no blue memories then
Whether skies are grey or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you
Don't do that, please stop it
Please stop it now
You know I can't take it
My head is spinning a spell on me now
My head is spinning around and around
Your witchcraft has got me
Keep going down and down
Let me forget her, don't mention her name
You know it brings back that old burning flame
It hurts to know that she don't feel the same
I can't go on since she left me alone
My one desire now is to cry, now to cry
She might come back one day by by and by
I'm working on the building
It's a true foundation
I'm holding up the blood-stained
Banner for my lord
Well I never get tired, tired, tired of working on the building
I'm going up to heaven to get my reward
You're a Heartbreaker
You're a love faker
A Heartbreaker playing with fire
You're a tear snatcher
You're a quarrel patcher
But you can't break my heart anymore
For I just found someone else
Who's sure to take your place
Someone I can always trust
And to fill this empty space
You're a smooth talker
You're a real cool walker
But now you have talked out of turn
You're a high stepper
You're a eye-catcher
But you won't catch my glances any more
I've got something to tell you
That I think you ought to know
That my eyes are on you baby
Since a long time ago
And now I finally got the nerve
And I'm gonna make my move
Now don't you try to turn me off
Cause it's gonna be hard to do
I've got a thing about you baby
Ain't nothing I can do
A thing about loving you
Ain't it just like a woman
When she knows she's got a man
She'll wring you out and turn you about
In the palm of her hand
And then she starts to thinking
Then maybe she's put you in a blind
She'll give you just a little lovin'
It'll drive you out of your mind
Is this train the Frankfort Special
Now ain't this outfit something special
Well, we heard rumors from the bases
Frankfort girls got pretty faces
Go, Special go. Blow whistle, blow
Frankfort Special's got a special way to go
Whoa - oh - oh
Now when we get to our headquarters
We'll be good boys and follow orders
Now don't take girls from one another
No! No! No! No! No!
We'll treat a sailor like a brother
Round wheels singing on a long flat track
Boiler busting to blow its stack
Towns and villages flying by
Farewell frauleins, don't you cry
You'll soon get another G.I
Come on, train, and get the lead out
Well, one more day we gotta sweat out
Frantic frauleins at the station
They're ready for a celebration
Whoa - oh
Whoa - oh, whoa - oh, whoa - oh, whoa - oh, whoa - oh
Whoa - oh, whoa - oh, whoa - oh
It's impossible, tell the sun to leave the sky
It's just impossible
It's impossible to ask a baby not to cry
Can I hold you closer to me?
And not feel you going through me
But the second that I never think of you?
Oh, how impossible
Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore?
If I had you, could I ever ask for more?
And tomorrow should you ask me for the world?
Somehow I'd get it, I would sell my very soul
And not regret it for to live without your love
Is just impossible
Oh, impossible
(Impossible)
Impossible
(You'll never know) You'll never know
(What heaven means) What heaven means
Until you've been down to New Orleans (New Orleans)
You ain't been livin' till you cuddle and coo
With a black-eyed baby by thee old bayou
(You've never seen) You've never seen
(Cupie doll queens) You've never seen those cupie doll queens
Like they got them in New Orleans (New Orleans)
And, ooh, they love you like no one can
It makes you awful glad that you were born a man
If-if-if you ain't been there (been there)
Then you ain't been nowhere (nowhere)
The living’s lazy and the loving’s fine (it's so fine)
If you feel low down (low down)
So help me Hannah (Hannah)
You should lose the blues in Louisi-ouisi-ouisiana
Get the lead
Get the lead out of your jeans
And hot foot it down, hot foot down to where?
New Orleans (New Orleans)
Louisiana baby tells you stay awhile (yeah)
Live it up, love it up, southern style
Way down in New (down in New)
New Orleans
I give, give you my heart
Today, tomorrow and forever
You'll always be my love
I vow we'll never part
Long as there's stars above
The cares of life will fade away
As long as we're together
So stay, stay in my arms
Long distance information give me Memphis, Tennessee
Help me find the party trying to get in touch with me
She could not leave her number, but I know who placed the call
My uncle took the message, and he wrote it on the wall
Help me, information, to get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high upon a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi bridge
Help me, information, more than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
Tore apart our happy home in Memphis, Tennessee
The last time I saw Marie, she was waving me goodbye
With hurry home drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
Marie is only six years old, Information please
Try to put me through to her in Memphis, Tennessee
My love I offer you now
My heart and all it can give
For just as long as I live I'm yours
No arms but yours dear will do
My lips will always be true
My eyes can only see you, I'm yours
And as the years roll along
Your joy and tears I'll gladly share
And when things go wrong dear
Just hold out your hand and I'll be there
With every beat of my heart
With every breath that I take
Now and forever, sweetheart, I'm yours
They call me poor boy, poor boy, poor boy
But I ain't lonesome and I ain't blue
'Cause I could never be a poor boy
As long as I've got a dolly like you
Ain't got a crust, ain't got a cent
Can't buy a jug, can't pay the rent
I got a heart full of dreams and a lot of memories
Can't buy a house, can't buy a lot
Ain't got a bean, ain't got a pot
But what I got is a heart full of love and memories
I've got a dolly like you
Don't have a pig, don't have a cow
I don't have a horse to pull a plow
I've got a dolly like
I remember my first love affair
Somehow or another the whole darn thing went wrong
My mama had some great advice
So I thought I'd put it into words of this song
I can still hear her sayin' it
"Boy, oh, I see you're sitting' out there all alone
Cryin' your eyes out
Cause the woman that you love has gone
Oh, there's gonna be, there's gonna be
A whole lot of trouble in your life
Oh, so listen to me, get up off of your knees
Cause only the strong survive"
That's what she said:
"Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Oh, you've got to be strong, you'd better hold on
Don't go all around with your head hung down"
Well, I wouldn't let that little girl
No, I wouldn't let her know
That she made me feel like a clown
"There's a whole lot a girl
Lookin' for a good man like you
Oh, but you'll never meet them if you give up now
And say, your life is through"
And she said it
Oh, you've got to be a man, you've got to take a stand
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive"
"Well, you've got to be strong, you'd better hold on
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Only the strong survive"
"Well, you've got to be a man, you've got to take a stand
I cry myself to sleep each night
Wishing I could hold you tight
Life seems so empty since you went away
And the pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my empty dreams instead
And it keeps right on a-hurting
It keeps right on a'hurting every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurting since you're gone
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
But when I see you passing by
My heart breaks down and cries a million tears
The pillow where you lay your head
Yes, it keeps right on a-hurting since you're gone
Make the world go away
Get it off my shoulder
Say the things we used to say
And make the world, make it go away
Do you remember when you loved me
Before the world took you away
Well if you do, then forgive me
Now I'm sorry if I hurt you
Let me make it up to you day by day
And if you will please forgive me
Yes, I'm gonna walk that milky white way
Oh Lord some of these days
Well, I'm gonna walk that milky white way
Some of these days well well well well
I'm gonna walk up and take my stand
Gonna join that Christian band
I'm gonna walk on that milky white way
Oh Lord, some of these days
I'm gonna tell my mother howdy, howdy
Howdy when I get home
Yes, I'm gonna tell my mother howdy
When I get home well well well well
I'm gonna shake my mother's hand
I will shake her hands that day
That's when we walk on the milky white way
On some of these days
I'm gonna meet God the father and God the son
Yes, I'm gonna meet God the father and God the son
Well well well well
I'm gonna sit down and tell Him my troubles
About the world that I just came from
Oh Lord, on some of these days
I saw three shrimp in the water, two were old and gray
I swam a little bit closer and. I heard the third one say
Goodbye mama shrimp, papa shake my hand
Here come the shrimper for to take me to Louisian
He showed his mama and papa, the shrimp newspaper he read
An invitation to all the shrimp and this is what it said
Free ride, New Orleans, stay in grand hotel
Big Creole gal who help you come out of your shell
If I should live to be ninety, I will never forget
The little shrimp and the song he sang as he jumped into the net
Step in these arms
Where you belong
It feels so right, so right
How can it be wrong?
There's something in the way you kiss
That makes me wanna hold you tight
I know that nothing can be wrong
That feels so right, oh
Each time we touch
You thrill me so
It means so much, so much
I can't let you go, yeah
This isn't only for tonight
We're gonna love our whole life through
'Cause baby, if it feels so right
We're gonna love our whole life long
Wish I was an apple dangling from a tree
Every time you'd pass me by you'd take a bite of me
I wish I was a bluebird, I'd never fly away
I'd sit up on your shoulder, baby, and sing to you all day
Come on home Cindy, Cindy
Come on home to me
I wrote it in a letter, carved it on a tree
Told it to a honeycomb, told it to a bee
Told them that I love you, they all know it's true
Say it till the cows come home, until it gets to you
Need you in the morning to start the coffee pot
Need you in the afternoon to fan me when I'm hot
Need you in the evening when supper time is through
What I'm really trying to say is I can't get enough of you
If I were a musician I'd harp on just one thing
You should never play my harp the way you pluck a string
If only you would love me, sincerely tell me so
I'd beat two drums about it baby to have the whole world know
Let the stars fade and fall
And I won't care at all
As long as I have you
Every kiss brings a thrill
And I know that it will
Let's think of the future
Forget the past
You're not my first love
But you're my last
Take the love that I bring
Then I'll have everything
As long, as long as I have you
Oh the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl I love
Her eyes are even bluer than Texas skies above
Her heart's as big as Texas and wherever I may go
I'll remember her forever because I love her so
There are so many roses that bloom along the way
But my heart's in Amarillo and that's where it will stay
With the yellow rose of Texas so I'd better get there fast
'Cause I know I was her first love and I want to be her last
The eyes of Texas are upon you all the live long day
The eyes of Texas are upon you, you cannot get away
Do not think you can escape them at night or early in the morn
The eyes of Texas are upon you 'till Gabriel blows his horn
Any day now I will hear you say
Goodbye my love
You'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird
You will have flown
Any day now
(Any day now)
I'll be all alone
(I'll be all alone)
Any day now, when your restless eyes
Meet someone new, to my sad surprise
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town
Love will let me down
(Love will let me down)
I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay, yeah
Until you've gone forever
I'll be holding on for dear life
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay
Any day now when the clock strikes go
You'll call it off, then my tears will flow
(Any day now, any day now)
And you won't be around
Any day now, any day now
Don't fly away, my beautiful bird
Any day now, don't fly away
The first noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the king of Israel
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Starting today
I'm teaching my heart
Not to ache anymore
Just because we're apart
No more will I dream
Of your sweet loving ways
Going to learn to forget you
And when memories haunt me
And the tears start to flow
I'll just think of the sorrow
You caused me to know
No more in the past
To return will I pray
Going to live for tomorrow
If you've got a problem, I don't care what it is
If you need a hand, I can assure you this
I can help, I've got two strong arms, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help
It's a fact that people get lonely, it ain't nothing new
But a woman like you baby, should never have the blues
Let me help, have a laugh on me, I can help
When I go to sleep at night, you're always a part of my dream
Holding me tight, telling me everything I want to hear
So don't forget me baby, all you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you, I can do anything at all
If your child needs a daddy, I can help
It's a wonderful life
This life I'm living
What a wonderful life, living a life of ease, oh-ho-oh
Well, I've got no job to worry me
No big bad boss to hurry me
It's a wonderful life life's good to me
It's a wonderful road
This road I'm traveling
It's a wonderful road heading beyond the hills, oh-ho-oh
Oh it may go straight or it may detour
But one thing that I know for sure
It's a wonderful life, life's good to me
Don't know where I'm going
Don't care where I'm going
Like the four winds are blowing I go on
Laughing the day away, loving the night away
Till the moon is gone
What a wonderful life
Living the life I love, oh yeah
Well I've got neighbors, I've got friends
Just about anywhere the rainbow ends
What a wonderful life, life's good to me, yeah
Crazy life, life's good to me
Oh what a life
From a jack to a king of loneliness to a wedding ring
I've played an ace and I won the queen
I walked away with your heart
From a jack to a king
With no regrets I stacked, I stacked the cards, I stacked the cards last night
And lady luck played her hand just right
You made me king of your heart
Oh for just a little while I thought that I might lose the game
Oh but just in time I saw that twinkle in your eyes
From a jack to a king of loneliness to a wedding, wedding, wedding ring
I played an ace and I won the queen
How many girls choose cotton dress worlds
When they could have satins and lace
And stand by her man
Never once letting shame touch her face
How many hearts could live through all the winters
We've known and still not be cold?
True love travels on a gravel road
Love is a stranger and hearts are in danger
On smooth streets paved with gold
Oh, true love travels on a gravel road, oh
Down through the years we've had hard times and tears
But they only helped our love grow
And we'll stay together no matter how strong the wind blows
Not once have I seen your blue eyes filled with envy
Or stray from the one that you hold
Oh, true love travels on a gravel road
Yeah, true love travels on a gravel road
How do you think I feel?
Well, I know your love's not real
The girl I'm mad about
Is just a gadabout
How do you think we stand?
Well, I know you've made your plans
But you've included three
And that's too much for me
I won't be true again
I know that I can't win
So why should I pretend
That you still love me?
Well, how do you think we stand?
I know you've made your plans
Another's pretty face
Has put me out of place
And you've included three
There's a sweet sweet spirit in this place
And I know that it's the spirit of the Lord
There are sweet expressions on each face
And I know that it's the presence of the Lord
Sweet Holy Spirit
Sweet heavenly dove
Stay right here with us
Filling us with your love
And for these blessings
We lift our hearts in praise (hearts in praise)
Without a doubt we'll know that we have been revived
When we shall leave this place
Acapulco, sleeping in the bay
Acapulco, wake up and greet the day
Time to tell the guitars and sleepy eyed stars
To be on their way
It's such a beautiful morning
For a holiday
Hey now come on, you old sleepy head
See the sky turning red and you're still in bed
It's fun in Acapulco
Acapulco, look here comes the sun
Acapulco, it's a day for fun
This is no time for siesta, this is time for fun
Well, I woke up this morning
And I looked out the door
I can tell that old milk cow
By the way she lowed
Hold it fellows, that don't move me
Let's get real, real gone for a change
I can tell that that old milk cow
I can tell the way she lowed
Well, if you've seen my milk cow
Please ride her on home
I ain't had no milk or butter
Since that cow's been gone
Well, I tried to treat you right
Day by day
Get out your little prayer book
For you're gonna need
You're gonna need
Your loving daddy's help someday
Well, then you're gonna be sorry
For treating me this way
Oh, let's milk it!
Well, believe me, don't that sun
Look good going down?
Well, don't that old moon look lonesome
When your baby's not around
Well, I tried everything to
Get along with you
I'm gonna tell you what I'm going do
I'm gonna quit my crying
I'm gonna leave you alone
If you don't believe I'm leaving
You can count the days I'm gone
I'm gonna leave
You're gonna need your
Loving daddy's help someday
Well, you're gonna be sorry
You treated me this way
If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share
Would always be
There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
And make us realize our night is over
When you walk away from me
There is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun
That rises over the land
Somehow I have to let you go
Because it's over
If you knew just how I really feel
You might return and yet
There are so many times
That people have to love and then forget
Oh there might have been a way somehow
I have to force myself to say
It's over
So I turn my back
Turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence
Trying not to think at all
I set my feet before me
Walk the silent street before me
Now it's over
Baby don't fall in love with me
I'll only bring you grief
Baby, don't set your heart on me
I'll only have to leave
Because the north wind flows through my veins
Like my dad there's a dream in my brain
In the morning I'll have to leave again
That's how it is when you inherit the wind
Inherit the wind
Daddy, he was a traveling man
I hardly knew his face
Momma, she cried for him at night
He never stayed in one place
Oh I can't give you the love you need
I just won't be here that long
But if you still want me here tonight
I'll love you till the break of dawn
Inherit the wind, inherit the wind
I've got a dirty, dirty feelin'
Dirty dealings goin' on
You know I almost hit the ceilin'
When I woke up and you were gone
I took you in when you were hungry
And now your cuttin' out on me
I'm gonna help you, little darlin'
That ain't the way it's gonna be
I hear you're pretty good at runnin'
But pretty soon you'll slip and fall
That's when I'll drag you home with me, girl
I'm gonna chain you to the wall (yeah)
You know I'm lookin' for you, baby
I ain't gonna take it layin' down
I heard that you were cookin', baby
Way on the other side of town
When I woke up and you were gone (gone)
That big eight-wheeler runnin' down the track
Mean your true lovin' Daddy ain't comin' back
'Cause he's Moving on, he's rolling on
You were flying' too high for my little old sky
So I'm moving' on
But some day, baby, when you've had your play
Your gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep moving on, keep rolling on
You were flying too high for my little old sky
So I'm moving on, move on, baby
Mr. Fireman, won't you please listen to me?
'Cause I gotta pretty momma in Tennessee
To keep rolling on, keep moving on
Please listen to me, let this rattler free
Keep moving on, move on, son, move on
Well, I told you, baby, from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
And now I'm moving on, I'm rolling on
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
But I'm moving on, move on, baby, move on
I said, "Move on", I said, "Move on"
Well, I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
I said, "Move on"
Hey, hey, hey, move on, I said, "Move on"
Hey, hey, I said, "Move on", I said, "Move on"
I'm through with you but too bad you're blue
I said, "Move on, move on, move on"
If you could see me now
The one who said that he would rather roam
The one who said he'd rather be alone
If you could only see me now
If I could hold you now
Just for a moment, if I could really make you mine
Just for a while turn back the hands of time
If I could only hold you now
Cause I've been too long in the wind
Too long in the rain
Taking any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
And lying in your loving arms again
If you could hear me now
Singing somewhere in the lonely night
Dreaming of the arms that hold me tight
If you could only hear me now
I can almost feel your loving' arms again
Every time I look at someone new
Tell me why I think of you
Then you sometimes ask me by
You're playing with love
Darling tell me why
You left me all alone
To cry over you
My heart is torn and broken
There's nothing left to do
In my prayers, I'll mention you
When you're gone I feel so blue
Why can't I have all of you
Oh, somebody, please tell me why
(Young dreams of love, young dreams of love)
Young dreams (Young dreams, young dreams)
My heart is filled with young dreams (dreams)
And I'm longing to
Share them all with you
In my eyes, (my eyes, my eyes)
Oh, can't you see in my eyes (in eyes)
That you're the only one who
Can make my young dreams come true
I have young arms
That want to hold you (hold you)
Hold you oh so tight
I have young lips (lips)
That want to kiss you (kiss you)
Kiss you morning noon and night
Take my hand (my hand, my hand)
Oh darling, take my hand (take hand)
And let me make you a part
Of all my young dreams of love
That wanna hold you (hold you)
Hold you good and tight
I have young lips
That wanna kiss you (kiss you)
Oh darling, take my hand, oh (take hand)
And let me make you a part (let me make you a part)
A part of all of my young dreams of love
(Young dreams of love, young dreams of love, yeah)
Hot dog, you say you're really coming back
Hot dog, I'm waitin' at the railway track
Hot dog, you say you're coming home for good
Hot dog, I'm gonna keep knocking on wood
And baby, I can hardly wait
I'm going to meet you at the gate, hot dog
I fell in love with you and then you went away
But now you're coming home to stay
Hot dog, soon everything will be all right
Hot dog, we're gonna have a ball tonight
I got a pocketful of dimes
It's going to be just like old times, hot dog
You went away and every day was misery
But now you're coming back to me
Hot dog, my heart is gonna go insane
Hot dog, when you come walking off the train
Oh, how lonely I have been
But when that Santa Fe pulls in
Hot dog, baby, hot dog (hot dog)
If I'm a fool for loving you
Then that's just what I want to be
They're saying I am just your clown
And any fool could see
That you're just having fun
And you're not in love with me
The things they're saying may be true
But there's something they can't see
If I'm a dreamer, let me dream
If I'm your clown I'll steal the show
If things are not the way they seem
Please don't ever let me know
If I am blind it's because
I just don't want to see
Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings a song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring
When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life
Is the thing I can't win
Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know
That I would fly away with you
The breeze along the river seems to say
That she'll only break my heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you when you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow
Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But movin' and a-groovin'
Going satisfy my soul
Let's have a party (let's have a party)
Send 'em to the store
And let's buy some more
And let's have a party tonight
I've never kissed a bear
I've never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken
In the middle of the room
Now Honky Tonky Joe
Is knocking at the door
Bring him in and fill him up
And set him on the floor
The meat is on the stove
The bread is gettin' hot
Everybody come and taste
The possum on the pot
We'll have a party tonight
Somewhere in, in the distant night
I hear Christmas bells
The gentle snow keeps falling down on people
Who are homeward bound
That's the way it's always been
The circle really never ends
Christmas seems to come and go
Home's a place that I don't know
Holly leaves and Christmas trees
It's that time of year
Lights aglow and mistletoe
Don't mean a thing when you're not here
As I walk, walk this lonely street
The sound of snow beneath my feet
I'll think of how, how it used to be
Used to mean so much to me
(Holly leaves and Christmas trees)
I could ride around the world in an old oxcart
And never let another girl thrill my heart
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you so?
I could meet a hundred girls and have loads of fun
My hugging and my kissing belong to just one
If you gave me nine lives like an alley cat
I'd give them all to you and never take one back
I'm putting on my Sunday suit and I'm going downtown
But I'll be kissing your lips before the sun goes down
I awakened this morning, I was filled with despair
All my dreams turned to ashes and gone, oh yeah
As I looked at my life it was barren and bare
Without love I've had nothing at all
Without love I've had nothing
I have conquered the world
All but one thing did I have
Once I had a sweetheart who loved only me
There was nothing, oh that she would not give, oh no
But I was blind to her goodness and I could not see
That a heart without love cannot live
Still I recall all the good times together
The love we shared, the fun and the laughter
How I wish you could feel what my heart says tonight dear
I miss you and I wish you were here
Dreams that I had they lay broken in sorrow
The plans I made the hopes for tomorrow
If I could I would tell you I'm lonesome tonight dear
Oh I miss you and I wish you were here
All through the night I will see memories passing
The way you looked the sound of your laughing
How I long for the touch of your hand holding mine dear
Lord, I miss you and I wish you were here
You say that you love me
And swear it to be true
But if you care to come over here
And make me know it do
Come on now, make me know it
Then go ahead and show it
You say you've got kisses
And swear that they're brand new
I think that's fine if you ain't lyin'
But make me know it do
You won't have no trouble
Proving it to me
Come right along, you'll find me
Helpful as can be
You say you wanna hold me
And stick to me like glue
Well hearing's deceiving and seeing's believing
Make me know it do
Well go ahead and show it
I say hearing's deceiving, seeing's believing
Oh, make me know it
Make me know it
Every man has a black star
A black star over his shoulder
And when a man sees his black star
Black star don't shine on me, black star
Black star keep behind me, black star
There's a lot of livin' I gotta do
Black star
When I ride I feel that black star
That black star over my shoulder
So I ride in front of that black star
Never lookin' around, never lookin' around
One fine day I'll see that black star
And when I see that old black star
The steps that lead to any church
Form a stairway to a star
They're part of God and should be trod
More often than they are
I believe in the man in the sky
I believe with his help I'll get by
My footsteps may falter
My eyes may grow dim
But he's my Gibraltar
I'm trusting in him
Though a sparrow is all I may be
On me he will still keep an eye
Yes I'm singing his praise
Till the end of my days
Sparrow, sparrow am I
Keep an eye
All that I am or ever hope to be
Lies in your hands
You are my destiny
When you are in my arms, I rule the world
And when we're far apart, how cruel the world
All that I want is to be near to you
To spend my life making it clear to you
You are my heart, my soul, my dream come true
All that I am, I am because of you
Because of you
I'm playing for keeps
This time it's real
And I want you to know
Exactly how I feel
For sure this time
And I won't be happy
Until I know you're mine
There have been others
That could love me true
But no one else
Can thrill me like you do
Oh, love me too
Oh, don't make me sorry
That I fell in love with you
That I fell in love with you (in love with you)
Well, there's a leak in this old building
Yes, there's a leak in this old building
We're gonna move to a better home
We got no pane in this old window
Well, there's a hole in the roof where the rain pours in
A hole in the floor where it drops right out again
Well, there's a crack across the ceiling
Yes, there's a crack across the ceiling
We're gonna find us a better home
We've gotta stove without a chimney
What good's a stove without a chimney?
Pulling down window shades is no use at all
The kids and the neighbor can peep right through the wall
Well, there's a leak in this old building (look out below)
We're gonna move to a better
Move to a better
Move to a better home
How the web was woven
In my soul, don't you know
Can't get loose, can't let go
Like the weave of a spider
Wound around my heart, I'm no longer free
At last I'm where you want me
Don't you know that's where, where I want to be?
Spinning 'round like a blue fly
Thoughts of you fill my head
And no matter, oh how I try
I can't sleep in my bed
I've been round for the last time
Oh girl, what can I do?
Oh, that's how the web was woven
How I fell in love, fell in love with you
Oh that's how the web was woven
O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the king of angels
O come let us adore him
Christ the lord
Sing choirs of angels
Sing in exaltation
Oh sing all ye rivals
Of heaven above
Glory to god, glory in the highest
Do you know who I am?
Have you had any idea who I am?
Yes, it's been quite a while
And it's so good to see you again
It's so dark in this place
That I can't see your face
May believe Oh I see
Does he know who I am
And what once was between you and me?
Do you know how I tried?
Have you any idea how I tried
Not to keep you in sight
Do you know darling how much I cried?
I remember you said
That you had to forget about me, and be free
Do you know who I am or have you forgot about me?
Do you think there's a chance
You and I could start over again
Is there a prayer you still care
Or has it just been too long and we're through?
Well, what about you and him?
Oh he's only a friend
Well I see there's still a chance for me
Well maybe some other time, in some other place
With our love in your heart and a smile on your face
You will know who I am
When that time comes you'll know who I am
When I was little my mama said to me
"Someday you'll find a love, son, to last eternally"
I want you with me everywhere I go
(I want you with me, I want you with me)
No, please don't leave me, baby, I love you so
(I want you with me, baby, I want you with me)
I'll be the ruler of this whole wide world
If you will only say that you'll be my girl
I want you with me in everything I do
(I want you with me, I want you with me
I want you with me, I want you with me)
Well, you know I need you, baby, I'm in love with you
(I want you with me, baby, I need it)
There is no mountain that I can't climb
You find the mountain, child, and I will find the time
I want you with me, with me night and day
Well, you can make me happy, baby, don't you go away
(I want you with me, baby, one more time)
I'll swim an ocean with a raging foam
If I know that you'll be there when I come back home
I want you with me, you know I love you so
Well, I want you with me baby, I'll never ever let you go
(I want you with me, baby, oh)
Yeah, I want you with me
I want you with me
Well, I want you with me baby, I'll never let you go
My Jesus knows when I am lonely
He knows each pain, he sees each tear
He understands each lonely heartache
He understands because he cares
My Jesus knows just what I need
Oh yes! He knows just what I need
He satisfies and every need supplies
Yes, he knows just what I need
Your lips were made for kisses so tender
I'm almost in love tonight
When we are close, my heart says surrender
And here under the spell of evening
I long to hold you tight
Heaven is near, why think of tomorrow
It may be just the spell of evening
Almost in love
It's a sin, my darling, how I love you
Because I know our love could never be
It's a sin to keep this memory of you
When silence proves that you've forgotten me
The dreams I built for us has tumbled
Each promise broken like my heart
So much in love and yet so far apart
I'm sure you're happy with another
Who shares the love I could not win
Why pretend that I can live without you
When deep inside I know that it's a sin
You gave me love to enjoy
Like a bright shiny toy to a baby
No matter what you would do
I depended on you like a baby
One thing I know I love you
Yes, I loved you like a baby
It was a fool's heart you took
And I fell 'cause you look like a baby
To lovers' ways, I was blind
'Cause I just had a mind like a baby
You're just a flirt
And I had to be hurt just like a baby
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I need you so, I need you so
The day I found how you lied
Then I broke down and cried like a baby
Well, it was then I could see
You were playing with me like a baby
Well, you can bet that someday
I'll forget just like a baby
Well, so long
Oh, how I hate to see you go
Yes, so long
Well the way that I will miss you
I guess you'll never know
We've been together so long
To have to separate this way
Well, I'm gonna let you go ahead on, baby
But let you come back home someday
Play the blues boys, play the blues
One more time
You said you once had loved me
But now I guess you've changed your mind
Why don't you reconsider baby
Give yourself just a little more time
Hold me tight
The moon is so bright
Tonight is so right for love
Now's the time to say
You're the one
One by one the stars appear
They twinkle in your eyes
Who'd believe that we'd be here
So near to paradise
This could be the kiss
To unlock heaven's door
That magic hour of bliss
That we both waited for
I love you more and more
Oh' we could fly right up to the sky
The things we've been dreaming of
And how real they would seem
A midsummer night's dream
Can't you see that tonight's so right for love
The moon's so bright
I'm sorry now, girl, but I must leave you
There's something deep inside my soul keeps calling me
The winter wind, girl, will not deceive you
And in your cold and empty bed, you'll think of me, oh yes
You'll think of me
You'll see me coming, you'll see me going
Don't ask me why, I'm just the kind needs to be free
Just like that outlaw wind keeps on a-blowing
Yeah, in your cold and empty bed, you'll think of me, oh yes
Now I know you loved me just like I wanted
I know you'd follow me across an endless sea
But, baby, I've got a heart that's haunted
Ah but you should know, girl, that I'll be crying
Out on that lonely road where not a soul can see
I'll shed my tears for a love that's dying
The summer sun, girl, will bring a stranger
And he'll be better to you than I used to be
And when he takes you into his arms, girl
Well, in your warm and loving bed, you won't think of me, no, no
You won't think of me
Then in your warm and loving bed, you won't think of me, no, no
Lordy, only believe, only believe
All things are possible if you'll only believe
My Lordy, only believe, yes, only believe
All things are possible, if you'll only believe
I met God one morning, my soul feeling bad
Heart heavy laden, I had a bowed down head
Well, He lifted all my burdens
Yeah, right now I'm feeling glad
I believe, yeah, I believe
I've been standing on a corner
Since a quarter after seven
I was down to my last cigarette
And the clock in the window
At a quarter to eleven
I was watching all the people
Passing by me going places
Just the loneliest guy in the town
Looking for a friendly smile
But all I see were faces
And then, just like the taste of milk and honey
I found the stranger I've been looking for
Like a wave, my cup of love was overflowing
I knew the stranger in the crowd
And I would be stranger no more
Love had found us on that corner
I thought you were too good to be true
All my life I had believed
That angels only live in heaven
But now, we share the taste of milk and honey
Each day is sweeter than the day before
My cup ran overflowing
Because the stranger in the crowd
Deep inside, my cup of love was overflowing
Jingle bell
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now, it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly, I don't have the laugh, I used to weep
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday, came suddenly
Why'd she have to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now, I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Take good care of her, take good care of her
I suppose I ought to say congratulations
For you won the only girl I ever loved
But I hurt too much to face the situation
Just take good care of her, take good care of her
Just to be around her was my greatest pleasure
She was everything my future held in store
So remember when you take my only treasure
I must accept it, she loves you more than me
So with my broken heart I'll bow out gracefully
Please don't send me any wedding invitation
For I couldn't bear to see her there with you
If she's happy, that will be my consolation
Oh, the way I feel tonight
You better wrap me up good and tight
In your arms
Just like a bee in a honeycomb
I'm going to make myself right at home
Well, it doesn't take much to keep me satisfied
Just a little bit of loving that's bonafide
In your arms keep me tangled up all the time
Like a kitten with a ball of twine
Yeah baby, that's where I want to stay
For the rest of my natural days
Known only to him are the great hidden secrets
I'll fear not the darkness when my flame shall dim
I know not what the future holds
But I know who holds the future
It's a secret known only to Him
In this world of fear and doubt
On my knees I ask the question
Why a lonely, heavy cross I must bear
Then he tells me in my prayer
It's because I am trustworthy
He gives me strength far more than my share
I can explain about last night
Though things didn't look just right
Please believe me there was nothing wrong
I thought about you baby all night long
Cross my heart, I hope to die
Well, I wouldn't tell you no lie
Talk about a piece of rotten luck
You do a friend a favor and you wind up stuck
She couldn't hold a candle to you, no siree
Very hard to handle like a model T
Please believe me when I say
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
From you because I don't have to look too hard
To see what I've got in my own back yard
So, please forgive me and forget
Don't say my alloy's all wet
I miss those kisses from your honeycomb
This humble bumble bee just wants to fly back home
I wouldn't tell you no lie
No, no, no, no, no, no
I left my home up in the hills far behind me
I left my wife with unpaid bills, she can't find me
I'm trying out the world for size, find that it's not paradise, it's lonely
Now for twenty days and twenty nights I've been alone
And that ain't right
Without her
City ways are strange to me, I can't make it
For it's not like it ought to be, and I can't take it
I've got to face the truth one day, man can't always run away from trouble
No, now for twenty days and twenty nights I've been a fool
One day soon I'm going back, where she still minds me
I've been out of line and off the track, but that's behind me
I fooled around and did it well, but I just couldn't ring the bell , without her, no
It's taken twenty days and twenty nights to prove me wrong and make her right
Twenty days and twenty nights I was wrong and she was right, all along
Oh, I miss her
Oh, how I miss her, oh how I miss her, oh how I miss her
I saw old pharaoh's daughter bring Moses from the water
I'll lick the guy that says it isn't so
I was born about ten thousand years ago
There is nothing in this world that I don't know
I saved king David's life and he offered me a wife
I said now you're talking business have a chair
Yeah, I was born about ten thousand years ago
Saw Peter, Paul and Moses playing ring around the roses
I was there when old Noah built the ark
And I crawled in the window after dark
I saw Jonah eat the whale and dance with the lion's tail
And I crossed over Canaan on a log
I saw Jonah eat the whale and Daniel twist the lion's tail
I'll go on loving you (loving you)
Don't ask me why (don't ask me why)
Don't know what else to do
Don't ask me why
How sad my heart would be (heart would be)
If you should go (if you should go)
Though you're not good for me
I want you so
It's not the kind
Of love I dream about
But it's the kind
That I can't live without
You're all I'm longing for (longing for)
Don't say goodbye (don't say goodbye)
I need you more and more
Every time you look at me
I'm as helpless as can be
I become a puppet on a string
You can do 'most anything with me
All you do is touch my hand
And your wish is my command
If you really love me
Darling please be kind
I'll offer you the truest love
That you will ever find
Take my heart and please be fair
Handle it with loving care
For I'm just a puppet on a string
It's the feeling that I get holding my brand new baby
Holding on to daddy's thumb just as tightly as he can hold
And it's hearin' people say he looks a lot like his daddy
These things are a poor man's gold
It's the twinkle in the eyes of the gray haired old man we call grandpa
Tellin' tales to the kids that get taller every time there told
And it's knowin' that for a while he's no longer lonely
It's the smell of honeysuckle in the springtime it's the silence of a freshly fallin snow
It's the sound of children laughing in the sunshine
It's a crisp autum night with a million stars all aglow
And it's the sweet sleepy sound of your warm gentle breathing
As you cling to me in the night to keep away the cold
And it's the softness of your body there in the darkness
Honey theses precious things are a poor man's gold
I have wished for the wealth
Of a great millionaire
I have reached for a bright star above
But the thrill of it all
To me seems so small
When compared to the thrill of your love
I'd rather give everything
That I own in this world
Than to be all alone and unloved
For no earthly price and no sacrifice
Is too much to give for your love
Your cheating heart will make you weep
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come the whole night through
Your cheating heart will tell on you
When tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You're gonna walk that floor the way that I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
You're gonna walk that floor just the way that I do
Now that the truth is hard to face
I can't forget you once were mine
Someone else is in my place
Whenever we meet my heart beats out of time
Just a little bit of green
Clouds my eyes to what I've seen
When I see you with someone new
And knowing that there's nothing I can do
Please don't try to tie me down
Those are the words you often say
I can't help seeing you around
You smile with surprise, I turn my eyes away
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Softly (Softly)
I will leave you (I will leave you softly)
For my heart would break (For my heart would break)
If you should wake (If you should wake)
And see me go (And see me go)
So I leave you (So I leave you)
Long before you miss me (Long before you miss me)
Long before your arms can beg me stay (Long before your arms can beg me stay)
For one more hour (For one more hour)
For one more day (For one more day)
After all the years (After all the years)
I can't bare the tears (I can't bare the tears)
To fall (To fall)
So softly, (So softly) so softly
(I will leave you there)
I will leave you
I will leave you there
Little darling, little darling
Oh where, are you, oo oo oo oo
Walla walla chipa mocka mogga
Oh my lover, oh just for you, only you
My darling, I need you
Darling I need you to call my own
To hold your life, your little foot, your hand
I knew someone would understand that
Hold my hand
My dear, I would run
To find without you
Oo oo oo oo oo
Oh, oo oo oo
That my love was just for you, 'n only you
Oh, please release me, let me go
For I just don't love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin
Oh, release me and let me love again
Oh, I have found a new love dear
And I will always want her near
Her lips are warm while yours are cold
Oh, release me, my darling let me go
Let me go
Oh, release me
My darling, let me go
Let me go, let me go
Oh, when the saints go marching in
Well, when the saints go marching in
I wanna be right there in that number, number
When the saints go marching in
Yeah, when the sun refuse to shine
When the sun refuse to shine
Go, go go
When the saints, the saints go marching in
I'm like a stranger
Like a stranger in my own home town
My so called friends stopped being friendly
Oh but you can't keep a good man down
Oh no, can't get him down
I came home with good intentions
About 5 or 6 years ago
But my home town won't accept me
Just don't feel welcome here no more
My home town won't accept me
About 5 or 6 years ago, yes I did
I'm like a stranger, like a stranger in my own home town
Yeah, I'm like a stranger, like a stranger in my own home town
On the hills of Georgia
Across the plains of Tennessee
I've seen and I've done most everything
That a man can do or see
But if I could only borrow one dream from yesterday
I'd be on that train tomorrow
I'll be home on Christmas day
And so many times before
She left that candle burning
Oh, too many tears fell
My soul fills with yearning
If I had sense at all
I'd just be on my way
Be on that train tomorrow
Be home on Christmas day
Every time I think about her
All the love I left behind
Memories still linger in my troubled mind
I could set aside my pride
And I'd be on my way
I'd catch that train tomorrow
And be home on Christmas day
If I had any sense at all
I'd be home on Christmas day
I said I'd catch that train tomorrow
Everybody's gone away
Said they're movin to L.A
There's not a soul I know around
Everybody's leavin' town
Some caught a freight, some caught a plane
Found the sunshine, leave the rain
They said this town will waste their time
I guess they're right, it's wasting mine
Some gotta win, some gotta lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues
You know my heart keeps tellin' me
You're not a kid at thirty-three
Play around, you'll lose your wife
You play it too long you'll lose your life
These long lonely evenings
Here I am on the phone
Wondering if she will call
She said she would write me
Because she knows I'm alone
But I hear nothing at all
I'm waiting for a word of love from Sylvia
You think she'd never heard of love my Sylvia
But when I'm with her Lord, I forgive her
Because she's more than the whole world to me
There's nothing like a word of love from Sylvia
The only one I'm thinking of is Sylvia
Feeling so sad now, I'll be so glad now
If I just had my Sylvia with me
That old weeping willow
Seems to whisper her name
Why did she go away
The tears on my pillow
They're not hard to explain
There's nothing else I can say
What's she really like
The girl that you see me with
The one I'm so dreamy with
Well, let me tell you she's wonderful
She's marvelous and she's mine
Talk about her lips, her lips are so thrillable
I can't describe her kiss in words of one syllable
She's even more than adorable
And what's moreable she's all mine
You're asking if she loves me
Well, you don't know the half
You're wondering if she'll leave me
Ha, ha, ha, don't make me laugh
The girl I go on about
The one I'm so gone about
All I can say, she's wonderful
Adorable and she's mine
Marvelous and she's mine
Wonderful and she's mine
If I should go, forget me never
Please say that you'll remember me
I pray the dreams we share together
Will shine on in your memory
Each time a star falls out of heaven
It leaves the sky a deeper blue
So if we part, forget me never
And don't forget my love for you
Who are you, who am I?
Are we more than strangers passing by?
Is this your dream are you in mine?
Are we really here or lost in time?
Will you be friend or lover
Show me the heart you conceal
Now is the time to discover
If this feeling we're feeling is real
So close to love and yet so far
Just one kiss will tell us who we are
Fool, you didn't have to hurt her
Fool, you didn't have to lose her
Fool, you only had to love her
But now her love is gone
Fool, you could have made her want you
Fool, you could have made her love you
Gone now the love and laughter
See yourself the morning after
Can't you see her eyes are misty
As she said goodbye
Oh Happy Day
When Jesus washed
Oh when he washed
Washed my sins away
And then he washed
Oh it's a Happy Day
He taught me how
To watch watch and pray
Watch and pray
And live rejoicing everyday
Everyday
Oh Happy Happy Day
And when I'll get to Heaven
Will be a Happy Day
Oh my Lord have mercy
When I'll get to Heaven
Oh Hapy Happy Day
I will be home again
Don't worry dear
I'll be home again
So won't you dry the tear
The promise in your eyes
Will see me through
There'll be brighter skies
When I come back to you
Ahh sweetheart, the love you're giving
Thrills my hungry heart
You make my life worth the living
Although we are apart
We'll start anew
Darling, until then
Our dreams will have to do
Back porch preacher preaching at me
Acting like he wrote the golden rule
Shaking his fist and speeching at me
Shouting from his soap box like a fool
Come Sunday morning he's lying in bed
With his eye all red, with the wine in his head
Wishing he was dead when he oughta be
Heading for Sunday school
Clean up your own backyard
Oh don't you hand me none of your lines
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine
Drugstore cowboy criticizing
Acting like he's better than you and me
Standing on the sidewalk supervising
Telling everybody how they ought to be
Come closing time 'most every night
He locks up tight and out go the lights
And he ducks out of sight and he cheats on his wife
With his employee
Armchair quarterback's always moaning
Second guessing people all day long
Pushing, fooling and hanging on in
Always messing where they don't belong
When you get right down to the nitty-gritty
Isn't it a pity that in this big city
Not a one a'little bitty man'll admit
He could have been a little bit wrong
It's a matter of time before I go back there
A matter of time before I go home
I have been way from her now for a long time
And I've lived a life I thought that it should be
It's a long, long way from now to maybe sometime
And the waiting round is really killing me
A matter of time oh Lord, before I go home
It's a long way I know and the goin' ain't easy
She'll see me again it's a matter of time
I think I'll take a train right early in the morning
Just to see how far I get along the way
But the trains don't run too often only sometimes
So I guess I'd better wait another day
She'll see me again, it's just a matter of time
She'll see me I know it's a matter of time
My wish came true (My wish came true)
When I met you (When I met you)
I've searched and searched
My whole life through (My whole life through)
There's just one thing (There's just one thing)
Dear before we start (before we start)
Don't say you care
Then break my heart
 (Then break my heart)
When you speak of love
Please be sincere
For if you play with love
It can bring tears my dear
To my surprise (To my surprise)
When you stood there
Before my eyes (Before my eyes)
And when my heart (And when my heart)
Started beating fast (Started beating fast)
It was then I knew
I found true love at last
Well, down in New Orleans at the Golden Goose
I grabbed a green-eyed dolly that was on the loose
Well, I dig that music, well she said, "Me too"
I said, "Pretty baby come on and let's do"
The Dixieland rock (Dixieland rock)
Well, the Dixieland rock (Dixieland rock)
Let your hair down Sugar, shake it free
And do the Dixieland rock with me
With the blue light shining on her swinging hips
She got the drummer so nervous that he lost his sticks
The cornet player hit a note that's flat
The trombone hit him while the poor cat sat
To the Dixieland rock (Dixieland rock)
I was all pooped out and when the clock struck four
But she said, no daddy can't leave the floor
She wore a clinging dress that fit so tight
She couldn't sit down so we danced all night
Let your hair dance Sugar, shake it free
(Dixieland, Dixieland)
(Dixieland rock with me)
My warped and worried mind resorts
To wandering off to ponder things I never talk about
A pretty girl I used to know
But wouldn't know if we met face to face
And defying every logic known
I wish the time machine could take me back again
To the wonder of my first love, the old folks tease me 'bout
Referring to her only as my little friend
Somewhere far away and maybe not so far away
A child has grown into a woman of the world
I assume this knowing that she knew so much of life
At such a tender age
I learned from her the whispered things
The big boys at the pool hall talk about
The thrill and disappointment
Fear and shame that first love brings
But oh, how I thought I loved my little friend
The fragrance of the green grass
Mingled with the scent of love and warming earth
The moonlight night I kissed and cried
And swore I'd never touch another girl
But time moved fast and I moved on
And I loved others time and time again
But with each time I thought of her
And always gave a little more
Assembled love and remembrance for my little friend
Oh-oh-oh assembled love, remembrance for my little friend
Gather round me buddy, raise your glasses high
And drink to a fool, a crazy fool
Who told his baby goodbye
Too late he found he loved her so much he wants to die
So drink to a fool, a crazy fool
He needs her, he needs her so
He wonders why he let her go
She's found, she's found, she's found
A new love buddy, he's a lucky guy
You're losing interest in me and it's showing
It is no big thing but it's growing
The pain of heartbreak I've just started knowing
Well, it is no big thing but it's growing
Well every day the hurt grows bigger than before
But I'll pretend I don't know this
Well, if I can hold you one day more
You've got the look of someone who's going
Well, you're going to leave me and it's showing
A little tear I can feel start to flow
Well it is no big thing but it's growing
No, it is no big thing but it's growing
They call me the tiger man
They call me tiger man
And I call my black cat back
My black cat comes a runnin'
And the hound dogs get way back
And the hound dogs stay way back
Blue river, it can't be found on any map that I know
But it's the place where lonely lovers all go
To cry their tears, blue river
It winds along a path of heartache and pain
Of broken dreams from loving someone in vain
Like I loved you, and baby I still do
I held you so tight
You were out of my sight
I'm feeling so low
But I got to go
Blue river because you never really cared about me
From now on baby that's where I'm going to be
Crying over you, by the river of blue
Now Adam and evil, they go hand in hand
Eve taught him sin, that's the way it all began
But every time you kiss me, my heart pounds like a drum
So if trouble is a woman, trouble here I come
I'm lonely like Adam, you're evil like Eve
I shouldn't take forbidden fruit 'cause I believe
I'll be heading straight for heartache
I should cut loose and run
But if loving you means heartache
Heartache, here I come
You're not the angel that I dreamed about
But you're the devil I don't want to live without
A woman's a woman, a man is a man
I can't be free I'm just putty in your hands
Who cares about tomorrow, I need your love tonight
And even if you're evil, baby hold me tight
And baby if you're evil, baby hold me tight
You know what it takes, you got it, baby
You are the only one I chose
I got a feeling for you, baby
And you're the only one who knows
About my troubles, troubles, troubles
When it rains, it really pours
You shouldn't have took away my love, dear
You know you thrill me from head to toe
You got what you wanted, now you left me
That's the way the story goes
Well, I got troubles, troubles, troubles
She wears my ring to show the world that she belongs to me
She wears my ring to show the world she's mine eternally
With loving care I placed it on her finger
To show my love for all the world to see
This tiny ring is a token of tender emotion
An endless pool of love that's as deep as the ocean
She swears to wear it with eternal devotion
That's why I sing, because she wears my ring
When Moses walked the children out of Egypt land
Said now don't you worry, we're in the Lord's hands
He's gonna walk beside us, the time is coming' near
He's gonna wash away all our misery and our fear
I got a feeling' in my body
This will be our lucky day
We'll be releasing all our sorrow
Leave it layin' along the way
When Daniel faced the lion there wasn't any doubt
You got to be like Daniel and the Lord will help us out
Won't you lift your eyes up children
Lift them to the sky
Heaven stands before you, gates are open wide
Shelter for the weary, comfort for the weak
We'll leave the devil's evil, sweatin' on the street
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta
I got a feeling in my body
I wanna know
I wanna know right now
Yeah. yeah, I got a feel
I got a feeling'
I got a feeling
Oh, baby, I'm gonna teach you what love's all about tonight
Trust me honey everything's gonna be all right
Just do like I do there ain't nothing to it
Listen to me, baby, anybody can do it
All you gotta do is just
Let yourself go
Now don't be afraid, just relax and take it real slow
Cool it, baby, you ain't got no place to go
Just put your arms around me real tight
Enjoy yourself, baby, don't fight
All you need is just a little rehearsal
The first thing that you know
You'll be ready for the grand finale
So come on, baby, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go
Take a real deep breath and put your warm red lips on mine
Just do like I tell you, everything's gonna be just fine
Kiss me nice and easy, take your time
Baby, I'm the only one here in line
Let yourself go right now Yeah! let yourself go
Yeh! let yourself go
All you gotta do is just let yourself go
Well children by and by when the morning comes
All the saints of God together they come
We will tell the story how the Lord will come
And we'll understand him better by and by
Trials dark on every hand and we cannot understand
All the ways God will lead us
To the blessed promised land
He will guide us with his eye
And we'll follow till we die
Temptation's hidden snares often take us unaware
And our hearts are made to bleed
For some thoughtless word or deed
And we wonder why the test when we try to do our best
But we'll understand it better by and by
Drums of the islands, you're beating in my heart
You're with me no matter where I roam
If ever I wander, if ever we're apart
I know that you will lead me home
If I should journey across the deep blue sea
I'll never forget these coral shores
Drums of the islands, I hear you calling me
And I'll return forever yours
I love each valley, each grain of sand, each hill
The flowers, the music of the isles
These are the things I love and always will
Though I may roam ten thousand miles
We call on him
Whenever storm clouds gather
We call on him to light our darkest day
Why must it be that only when we're lonely
And hopes are dim, we call on him
Why don't we call on him before we lose our way
To count our blessings and thank him while we may
When no one else will answer
We ask of him a reason to go on
When our cup of joy becomes a cup of sorrow
Filled to the brim, we call on him
Ask me if I wanted to caress you
And I'd confess
Ask me if I'm longing to possess you
I'll answer yes
Now that we're together
I could hold you close forever
And I swear that I would never let you go
There's no question that I care more than you
Love me darling, just be mine completely
And there's nothing I won't do if you
Just ask me
Dating is a game that grownups play
Dating means acting in a silly way
Dating makes girls start wiggle walking
Dating makes a guy start baby talking
Dizzy like children on a merry-go-round
Grownups are the biggest kids I've found
You'd think they belonged in a baby carriage
They're doing things that lead to marriage
But don't you laugh at what they do, oh no
Cause some day you'll be dating too
Dating makes a guy comb his hair just right
His girl can mess it up when they kiss good-night
Dating makes you quarrel and say you'll break up
And just because it's so much fun to make up
Children can't wait to grow up but then
They're dating and they're acting like kids again
Some day you'll be dating too
I may not be here tomorrow
But I'm close beside you today
So lie to me a little, say you love me a lot
And I'll be true to you in my way
Love never goes on forever
At least that's what wise men all say
So smile when you kiss me, tomorrow you may cry
But I'll be true to you in my way
Yes, I'll be true to you in my way
One night of sin, yeah
Is what I'm now paying for
The things I did and I saw
Would make the earth stand still
Don't call my name
It makes me feel so ashamed
I lost my sweet helping hand
I got myself to blame
Ain't never did no wrong
Now I know that very quiet life
Has caused me nothing but harm
One night of sin
But now I know that very quiet life
Well it's so very hard to have
To leave the one you love
And you get more lonely
With each passing day
It's so lonely just sitting
And dreaming of
That girl thousand miles away
Yes, it's still lonely having
Just her picture here with me
And I know I just can't stand it anymore
I'm going to leave right now
And go back where I ought to be
Going home to the girl that I adore
Well, every time I hear
Her sweet voice on the telephone
Then I know I just can't stand it another day
I'm going to call right back
And tell her that I'm coming home and stay
Call her back and say I'm coming home and stay
Long ago and far away
In my old common labor shoes
I turned the world all which-a-way
Just because you asked me to
Likened to no other feel
Summer love is simple truth
There's no end to what I'd do
Let the world call me a fool
Let it; things are right with me and you
That's all that matters and I'll do
Anything you ask me to
Knowing how much I love you
After all I've been through
I'd turn and walk away from you
If I get home on Christmas day
I won't need soft words to say
I'll miss you and I can stay a while
You'll see it in my eyes and when I smile
If I get home before midnight
While you're still sleeping tight
I'll take you in my arms and there you'll stay
Writing letters everyday
Never really seem to say
The way I feel deep in this heart of mine
Thought I'm half a world away
If we're patient and we pray
Know I'll get my chance with you this time
Hello, misfortune, how's my old friend "Mr. Misery"?
I've been away so long
I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me
I got no bed to rest my head
No doors or walls or window pane
Now all I needed was the rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain
Met a little honey
At the Buzzing Bumble Bee Cafe, yes, I did
One drink and all my money
And that honey bee had flown away
I'm 'bout as low as I can go
I don't really mean to complain
All I needed was this rain
All I needed was the rain
I look at you and wham, I'm head over heels
I guess that love is a banana peel
I feel so bad and yet I'm feeling so well
I slipped, I stumbled, I fell
One crazy kiss and boom, I head for the skies
I guess that love is like a cake of ice
You skate along but then you can never tell
I never thought I'd get tricked by your sweet talking lies
You got a bag of tricks
And when you got busy I got dazzled and dizzy
I fell like a ton of bricks
My knees are weak, my head is spinning around
I guess that love has turned me upside down
Thought I'd get hurt, but gee, it's turning out swell
If today was not endless highway
If tonight was not an endless trail
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all
Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
Only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again
I can't see my reflection in the water
I can't speak the sounds that show no pain
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
I can't remember the sound of my own name
If only she was lying by me
There's beauty in the silver singing river
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky
But none of these and nothing else could match the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes
If today was not an endless highway
If tonight was not endless trail
There's a guy who said one time -
He said -
You never stood  in that man's shoes
Or saw things through his eyes
Or stood and watched with helpless hands
While the heart inside you dies
So help your brother along the way
No matter where he starts
For the same God that made you made him too
These men with broken hearts
Our friends all ask me
The last time I saw you
And I smile and tell them
It's been a day or two
There's no way to explain it
The way that I miss you
And my love, you have left me
Indescribably blue
I talk to your picture
My favorite one of you
I wish that you were here with me
But what good will it do
Having no way to tell you
The pain that I've been through
Oh, my love, you have left me
Yes, my love, you have left me
I'll pack up all my things and walk away
I don't want to hear another word you have to say
I've been waiting for so long
I just found out there's something wrong
And nothing will get better if I stay
There's no need to explain anymore
I tried my best to love you, now I'm walking out the door
You used me, you deceived me
And you never seemed to need me
But I'll bet you won't forget me when I go
Seems I've been lost in a dream
Pretending that you care
But now I've opened up my eyes
And found it's all been just a great big fairytale
I've been loving' you so long
Don't think I'd even know how to forget you
But now the way that things have been
I think I'm better off alone
Than to be with you
Seems like I've been lost in a dream
Pretending you were mine
Someday you'll open up your eyes
And realize that a good man's hard to find
I don't want much
Just want a little bit
Don't want it all
Just a little bit
Give me an eeny weeny bit
A teeny weeny bit of your love
Turn your lamps down low
Slip me a kiss
Turn your lights down low
I won't let you resist
I want an eeny weeny bit
Early in the morning
Well just a little bit
Around midnight
Walk with me
I said talk to me
I want you to remember
To say that you'll be mine
Say you'll never leave me
Cousins, kissing cousins
Kissing's allowed because we're proud to be cousins
What's a little teasing, hugging and a-squeezin
Between us cousins
Oh it's so great to be one big family
And we show it, yes we show it
You see, we never feud, we're a happy brood
Folks all know it, yes they know it
Honey we dress and we mess
We're just cousins
Oh you tell me that you love me
Yes you tell me that you care
That tomorrow we'll be married, oh
But tomorrow's never there
Oh tomorrow never, never comes
Oh tomorrow never comes
Now you tell me that you love me, oh
But tomorrow never comes
Many weeks now have I waited
Oh many long nights have I cried
But just to see that happy morning, happy morning
When I have you right by my side
But tomorrow will never come, oh no, no
Tomorrow never going to come
Now you tell me that you love me
But tomorrow never, never comes
So tomorrow I'll be leaving
Yes tomorrow I'll be gone
But tomorrow you'll be weeping, oh
But tomorrow will never, never come
Well tomorrow will never, never come
Oh no, tomorrow ain't never going to come
Yeah, yeah, you tell me, you tell me
That you love me, but tomorrow never comes
You needn't sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter anyhow
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out, look out your window, baby, I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm travellin' on
Yeah, don't think twice, it's all right
I'm headed down that long lonesome road, girl
Where I'm bound I can't tell
Goodbye is too good a word, girl
I'll just say, "Fare thee well"
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I, I don't mind
You just sorta wasted my precious time
Ooh, don't think twice, it's all right
Take it home
Well, look out your window, baby, I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm movin' on
Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, girl
Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
You just kinda wasted my precious time
Take it
I see the sunlight in her hair
I feel the warm smile that she wears
She has no recipe for love
But I just can't get enough
From the distance of my mind
Clock that's ringing says it's time
Wake up to my destiny
It's time to face reality
It's only love that I feel inside
But I'll get by somehow
It's only love, there must be something else for me girl
I tell myself that it's not real
There's nothing left for me to feel
I'll just be going on my way
Tomorrow brings another day
But I've got to be strong, my mind's hanging on
It's only love, but I know I'll get by
I'll take my heart and my pride, and just throw it aside
It's only love
It's only love, it's only love, it's only love
Look at you and tell myself
How wonderful you are
You're so different now
To me you're much more wonderful, more wonderful by far
Yes, you're different now
There's more to love than holding hands and stealing kisses
No-one else around
There's the good times and the bad
There's the ups and downs we've had
But it's different now I'm so glad I still have you
There's always something new to see
I look at you, you look at me
And we're so different now
Love gets better every day 'n in some peculiar way
It's always different now
If we ever say goodbye, you'd be lost
And so would I, what's the difference now between us
Love just for a day, and a love that's here to stay
That's the difference now, the difference now
I'm falling in love, tonight
Somehow, I know
The beautiful world tonight
Is sharing, it's glow
When love let me down before
I said I was through
But I'm falling in love tonight
With you
Until you walked by
I laughed and played the game
One last kiss, then goodbye
And out went the flame
But somehow, you've changed me dear
This time, it's true
I'm falling in love tonight
If you're in old habits
Set in your old ways
Changes are a-coming
For these are changing days
And if your head is in the sand
While things are going on
What you need, what you need
What you need is a change of habit
Now if you're in the habit
To let your temper fly
When you talk with people
Who don't see eye to eye
And if you don't believe it
There's a newer world ahead
A change of habit, a change of outlook
A change of heart, you'll be alright
The halls of darkness, have doors that open
It's never too late to see the light
So if you're in the habit
Putting people down
Just because they're different
From the wrong side of town
Well, don't count on any medals, son
They're pinning none on you
Change of habit, hmm, change of habit
Change of habit
I thank the Lord for everything
When things are going my way
He said to me, 'I will comfort thee'
'And drive your cares away'
He promised me, 'I will walk with thee'
I did not ask for riches
He gave me wealth untold
The moon, the stars, the sun, the sky
Are there for you to behold
And I count my blessings each day
He came to me when I needed Him
I only have to pray
And He'll come to you - if you ask Him to
He's only a prayer away
One boy, two little girls
Three hearts yearning for love
Although it's hard to explain
I know it may sound insane
But this one boy loves two little girls
Folks say three is a crowd
To each boy, one girl's allowed
But right now I'm having such fun
I just can't give up either one
Because this one boy loves two little girls
There will come a time, I'll have to settle down
But until that time I love two girls hanging around
Now one day I must decide which one I'll choose for my bride
But till we three must part
I've twice as much love in my heart
I don't know just what I'd do
If the Lord wasn't walking by my side
When I was drifting
(When I was drifting on the sea of a despair)
And I was wondering
(I was wondering if Jehovah's up there)
When Jesus found me
(Jesus found me in my sinful life)
He heard me praying
(He heard me praying on my knees at night)
And now I'm singing
(Now I'm singing this happy song)
Because I'm happy
(Because I'm happy as I go along)
And I don't know
(I don't know)
Just what I'd do
What would I do
(What would I do when a tear fills my eyes)
(What would I do when it's my time to die)
Well I'd be lonely, discouraged
Burdened on the way
If the Lord wasn't walking by my side every day
I'd be so friendless
(I'd be friendless all alone and blue)
And I'd be helpless
(I'd be helpless, wouldn't know what to do)
If the Lord (wasn't walking) wasn't walking by my side
(wasn't walking by my side)
The walls have ears, ears that hear each little sound you make
Every time you stamp, throw a lamp, and every cup and dish you break
But they can't hear a kiss or two arms that hold you tight
So come on baby, don't fight tonight
The walls have ears, better think before you fling that shoe
If you part my hair with a chair, they'll spread the news to Timbuktu
Jets can fly, fast and high, rockets can go even faster
But they can't catch or even match sound traveling through plaster
Just dim the light
Don't fight tonight
Why must I love a heartless woman
Who never knows the harm she's done
Though love is blind I should have known
Just call me lonesome from now on
I climb the stairs up to my room
But no-one greets me in my gloom
The silence tells me she is gone
These walls will hide me when I cry
I hope that heaven lets me die
What good is life when hope has gone
Oh Blessed Mother we pray to Thee
Thanks for the miracle of Your Rosary
Only You can hold back
Your Holy Son's hand
Long enough for the whole world to understand
Hail Mary full of grace
The Lord is with Thee
Blessed are thou among women
And blessed is the fruit of Thy womb, Jesus
Oh Holy Mary dear Mother of God
Please pray for us sinners
Now and at the hour of our death
And give thanks once again
For the miracle of Your Rosary
Lover doll, oh lover doll (lover doll)
Lover doll, lover doll (lover doll)
You're the cutest lover doll
That I ever did ever see
Let me tell you lover doll
You were meant, just meant for me
On the first time that I saw you
How I fell for your cuddly charms
Lover doll, I'm crazy for you
Let me rock you in my arms
I'm so glad I found you
Never thought dollies came full grown
I'm gonna tie a ribbon around you
Wrap you up and take you home
I would never treat you badly
Like a cast away broken toy
Lover doll, I love you madly
Let me be your lover boy
Lover doll, lover doll (Lover doll, lover doll)
You're the reason I'm livin'
Oh, you carry me through
All of life's little burdens
I'd be lost without you
You're the reason I do things
You're the things that I do
A long, long time ago
When I was down
Oh, dear, you took me in and showed me
True love still could be found
Hey
All right
Clambake, gonna have a clambake
Mamma's little baby loves clambake, clambake
Mamma's little baby loves clambake too
Hey, listen world you've got to know
I'm cutting loose and letting go
Who needs the worry and the strife
Life can be a ball now just following my life
Look for the brightest lights in town
That's where you'll find me hanging round
I've got this feeling to be free
I pick and choose the life I want and that's the life for me
Clambake, gonna to have a clambake
(Mamma's little baby loves clambake, clambake)
(Mamma's little baby loves clambake too)
I'm gonna walk, walk them golden stairs
Cause I know my Jesus answers all my prayers
Well, well I know when he calls me to my home on high
I'll walk them golden stairs when I die, when I die
Oh lord you know I can hardly wait
To reach that suite by by by and by
And now I see those pearly gates
When Jesus says to me well done
And all my cares are laid by
I'll lay down my soul, my battles are won
I'll walk them golden stairs when I die when I die
In the early morning rain
With a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart
And my pockets full of sand
I'm a long ways from home
And I missed my loved one so
With no place to go
Out on runway number nine
Big 707 set to go
Well, I'm out here on the grass
Where the pavement never grows
Where the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
There she goes my friend
She's rolling out at last
Hear the mighty engines roar
(Hear the mighty engines roar )
See the silver wing on high
(See the silver wing on high )
She's away and westward bound
For above the clouds she flies
Where the morning rain don't fall
And the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home
In about three hours time
This old airport's got me down
It's no earthly good to me
Because I'm stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I might be
Can't jump a jet plane
(Can't jump a plane)
Like you can a freight train
(Like a freight train )
So I best be on my way
Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-i-ee-i-o
And on that farm he had some chicks, ee-i-ee-i-o
With a cluck, cluck here, a cluck, cluck there
Loud as they could be
And when those chicks got out of line
Chicken fricassee
Well, Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-i-ee-i-o
And on that farm he had some cows, ee-i-ee-i-o
With a moo, moo here, a moo, moo there
Cattle everywhere
And when those cows got out of line
Hamburger, medium rare
Oh, Well, Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-i-ee-i-o
And on that farm he had some pigs, ee-i-ee-i-o
With an oink, oink here, an oink, oink there
Pigs everywhere in sight
And when those pigs got out of line
Pork and beans at night
Well I'm going to have a farm one day, ee-i-e-i-o
And I'll do things MacDonald's way, ee-i-e-i-o
A moo, moo here, a moo, moo there
An oink, oink here, an oink, oink there
And I can promise you
If those animals ever get out of line
We'll have a mulligan stew
How about you?
Something old, the time's gone by
Something new, these tears I cry
Something borrowed were those lips my lips knew
And that's why I'm something blue
Something old, the vows we made
Something new, the price I paid
Something borrowed, love was tried but not true
Now my life is something blue
I guess that I had better smile
Walking behind you down the aisle
I feel I'm walking to my doom
I'm really not the best man in this room
Something old, the dreams we planned
Something new, his wedding band
Something borrowed was the heart I gave you
You returned it torn in two
And that's why
Tomorrow night
Will you remember what you said tonight?
Will all thrills be gone?
Tomorrow night (tomorrow night)
Will it be just another memory
Or just another lovely song
That's in my fool heart to linger on?
Your lips are so tender
Your heart is beating fast
And you're willing to surrender
Tell me, darling, will it last?
Will you be with me when the moon's bright?
Will you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Will you say those lovely things
You said tonight?
May this tenderness cling
When the fire of Spring
Is a memory
May you still be my own
When a hundred years have flown
But if it can't be
Give this moment to me
While our dream is bright
Put your sweet arms around me
And love me tonight
Love me tonight
Let me feel your lips on mine
And though I pray
Forever and a day I'll be
Possessing you
I'll confess to you
If I knew that our love would be gone
With the stars in the dawn's grey light
I'd still hold you close and whisper
I'll take you home again, Kathleen
Across the ocean wild and wide
To where your heart has ever been
Since first, you were my bonny bride
The roses all have left your cheek
I watch them fade away and die
Your voice is soft whenever you speak
And tears bedim your lovely eye
Oh, I will take you home, Kathleen
To where your heart shall feel no pain
And when the fields are soft and green
I will take you to your home, Kathleen
When was the last time you kissed me
And I don't mean a touch now and then
It's been a long time since you felt like my woman
Even longer since I felt like your man
So tell me if you think it's over
And I'll leave it up to you how it ends
Because if you don't want the love I can give you
Well, there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in
You never look at me and say, "I love you"
How much more do you think I can stand?
Oh, and there's an old friend out there and she's waiting
Lord, she's happy just holding my hand
Yes, there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in
When I was a little bitty boy
Sitting on my papa's knee
I still remember every word my papa said to me
Now boy if you ever meet
A pretty woman walking down the street
You'd better
Stop real still, look both ways
Listen or you'll get in trouble
When you see her go strutting by
Giving you that evil eye
And she's got a kind of dreamy look
Just enough to get you shook
Now boy don't you lose your head
You pay attention what your papa said
All right !
She'll drive you crazy with the way she walks
She'll drive you crazy with the way she talks
And you'll think you're going to lose your mind
Cause that pretty woman looks so fine
And the very first thing you'll know
You'll be telling her you love her so
You'd better stop real still
The girl next door went a-walking
She found the boy she likes
She wanted to get married
Settle down for life
She knew it wasn't right
She came home at half past ten
Late every night
She didn't know love was so grand
She never took love second hand
But to my surprise
She thought that love was paradise
Now the two are married
Settled down for life
She walks by hand in hand
If you found someone new who means more than me to you
I'd never stand in your way
If you feel we must part, don't let pity rule your heart
I'll never stand in your way
I love you much too much to ever lose you
But what is to be will be and I'll obey
I'll be blue when you go but I'll never let it show
I loved you much too much to ever lose you
I woke up this morning and I tried to call you, mmm
But you weren't there, kinda put me in despair
So I thought that maybe I could lose my mind
In the countryside so I went for a ride
But I never stopped thinking about you
Found myself wishing you were there
Just to be with me, feel the breeze
Sun didn't smile I didn't care
I decided to try just one more time
To let you know I really love you so
Before I arrived I saw you go away
With another guy, a tear filled my eye
A long time has passed since that day I cried
Life is fine and I'm doing fine
When I'm at home and I feel all alone
Well I think of you, try to get a message through
The clock by the bed is ticking too loud in the quiet night
I lie in the darkness thinking I must go before it's light
Before you open up your eyes and you beg me to stay
I'll leave 'cause I can't stand to see you hurt this way
Sleep my love as I kiss you goodbye
Then I won't hear the sound of your cry
Though I knew the time was coming and our love would end somehow
I just couldn't bear to tell you exactly just when or how
I know we can't go on, that it was wrong to start
But if you wake up crying now, you know you'll break my heart
Ohhhh, Sleep my love as I kiss you, kiss you, kiss you goodbye
Ohhhh, Sleep my love as I kiss you
It's a long lonely highway when you're travelling all alone
And it's a mean old world when you got no-one to call your own
And you pass through towns too small to even have a name, oh yes
But you got to keep on going, on that road to nowhere
Got to keep on going, though there's no-one to care
Just keep moving down the line
It's a long lonely highway without her by my side
And it's a trail full of teardrops that keep on being cried
My heart's so heavy it's a low down dirty shame oh yes
You got to keep on going, on that road to nowhere
I got to rock for my pillow beneath a weeping willow
And the cool grass for my bed
My drinking water's muddy so don't you tell me buddy
That I wouldn't be better off dead
It's a long lonely highway getting longer all the time
And if she don't come and get me
Well, I'm going to lose my mind
So if you read about me tell her she's the one to blame, oh yes
Moving down the line
Sentimental me, guess I'll always be
So in love with you, say you love me too
Sentimental me
Dreaming while I live, living just to give
All my love to you, no one else will do
Reaching for the moon
And no wishing on the stars
On my honeymoon
I want to be where you are
Darling, can't you see? It was meant to be
I'm in love with you, say you love me too
If you think I don't need you
Then take a look in my eyes
Maybe these ain't raindrops
Falling out of the sky
Since you been gone
I've been so alone
Then baby you're wrong
If you think I don't love you
What could I do to prove to you baby
My love is true
I sing the same old song
Since you've been gone
My life ain't been the same since you left me
I ain't had a wink of sleep in seven days
I don't know what to do I'm going crazy
I just walk the floor at night and call your name
If you think I don't do right
I'll change my ways
I'll do like you want me to, I'll be your slave
Well baby you're wrong
If they say we were doing wrong
If they say we were out too long
Well, you can say
My arms were just too strong
Put the blame, put the blame on me
Felt so good when I held you tight
Couldn't stop when we kissed Goodnight
So if they tell us we don't heave the right
What I feel is deep inside
This is real and I won't hide
Go ahead, use my name
I'll be proud to take the blame
You just did what I did you do
You love me and I love you too
So if the way they talk can bother you
Nothingville
Born in a two bit town
Where nothing's real
They treat me like a country clown in
I ain't gonna keep a-hanging 'round
While doors keep slamming in my face
People keep putting me in my place
It's a rat's race at a snail's pace
Nothingville, Nothingville
Don't be afraid, you and I were made the same, little one
And I know what it's like when you feel left out of the game, little one
But if you take this helping hand that I lend
Then we can smile together, let's be friends
The world that you see may seem to be a mystery to you
The night may be dark but hope very hard and dreams can come true
You live in silence, but for once let's pretend
We're talking here together, let's be friends
You're not alone, I've always known that we'd get along
And someone I know says life is good and He can't be wrong
There's fun and laughter just waiting 'round the bend
Let's find them now together, let's be friends
Sweetheart we're alone
And you are mine
Let's make this night a night to remember
Don't make our love a cold dying ember
For with the dawn, you'll be gone
Hold me close in your arms as the night withers away
Let's not waste one precious kiss while we're together
Oh please come to my arms and say you'll love me forever
Sweetheart when you're near
My heart is aflame
Your lips pressed on mine is heaven descending
And I could die because it is ending
Let these passions we feel in our hearts never end
I could never share this feeling with another
Oh please say that you feel the same knowing no other
Sandman's comin', yes he's comin'
To sprinkle you with sand
He'll say "one, two, three"
And you'll be, In cotton candy land
He'll take you, by the hand
And you'll ride upon, a big white swan
In cotton candy land
You and the swan will float upon
A cloud of pink ice cream
Where every star is a candy bar
And the moon is a marshmallow dream
Take his magic hand
Now goodnight...now sleep tight
If I can never see you, if I can never hold you
If I can never touch your face or feel your warm embrace
I still remember talkin', I still remember laughin'
I still remember lovin' a lot, yes
And touchin' you babe, I've not forgot
Only bringing it back, only just bringing' it back
A familiar face, a familiar face just brings it all back
Everything's bringin' it back, good songs bringing' it back
Even after so much time, everything's bringin' it back
Thinkin' in my solitude, wonderin' about your attitude
Thinkin' maybe that your love has died
There it is, I can see it in your eyes
A look of sweet surrender, a touch of too much sadness
Cause I've hurt you so, you know your sorrow shows
You just can't stay, but you can't let go
Girl happy, yes I'm girl happy
Girl happy, can't you see
Every girl I see looks good to me
What a crazy way out way to be
I love a life of nothing but beautiful women
Well I'm Girl happy, yes I'm girl happy
Every time I see a pretty face
My heart just heads for outer space
I need a girl to make my life worth living
Yes, I'm Girl happy, yes I'm girl happy
I've been like this since I was just a baby boy
First nurse that ever rocked my cradle made me jump for joy
Mama keep your daughter out of sight
I'm in a loving mood tonight
Girl happy, well I'm girl happy
Yes I'm girl happy, can't you see
Girl happy, said I'm girl happy
I've been thumbing rides travelling light
Walking the streets till past midnight
Tramping roads, trails and lanes
Scaling cliffs fields and plains
Searching till the early dawn
For that long legged girl with the short dress on
Riding trucks, bikes and skis
Sailing lakes and brooks and seas
Driving wagons, cars and jeeps
Walking stilts in ten foot leaps
And everywhere I go she's been and gone
She's fine, it's just too bad she's the travelling kind
So fine, I just can't rest till I make her mine
I've been from Maine to Tennessee, Mexico and Waikiki
Rain or shine, sleet or snow
Searching high, searching low
Everything depends upon
That long legged girl with the short dress on
The long legged girl with the short dress on
I saw the harbor lights
They only told me we were parting
Those same old harbor lights
That once brought you to me
I watched the harbor lights
How could I help it?
Tears were starting
Good-bye to golden nights
Beside the silvery seas
I long to hold you dear
And kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship
And I was on the shore
Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart keeps praying
That someday harbor lights
Will bring you back to me
Show me a girl with a dimple on her cheek
But it melts in her mouth when she opens it to speak
Show me a girl who is acting so refined
And I'll show you a girl with one thing on her mind
So I say, "You know what?"
She says, "What?", I say, "What?
Oh, I'm not the marrying kind"
"For you've got what it takes
And it takes what you've got
But I'm not the marrying kind"
"Don't kiss me, don't claw me
Don't pet me, don't paw me
I won't leave my freedom behind"
"You know what?", She says, "What?"
I say, "What? Thanks a lot
"I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
Now you've got what I'm not
I'm not the marrying kind"
"Oh, I'm not the marrying kind
Farewell, Royal High School
We'll remember you
Dear alma mater
We're steadfast, loyal, and true
As we go onward
In the lives we lead
Your light will guide us
Your motto is our creed
We will look back fondly
At your ivy walls
Recalling precious moments
Within your hallowed halls
Just leave it to me
Don't ever be ashamed
Just give me a chance
I'll take care of everything
Your troubles I'll share
Let me know and I'll be there
I'll take care of you
Anyplace and anywhere
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand if you can
Be truthful to me
I'll be truthful to you
I'm in love with you so
Till I don't know what to do
So, let's call it a day
I've said all I have to say
Except don't forget to pray
And shake a hand every day
Who wants to buy a heart
One broken lover's heart
One broken heart for sale
Well, excuse me if you see me crying like a baby
Since she rejected me
There's nothing left to save me
She would not listen to the things my heart was saying
She turned and walked away
And told me I was playing
Some guys have all the luck
And my heart hasn't any
I think I'll paint a sign
For sale for a penny
Who wants...
She's sitting right over there
I'd know that face anywhere
I'd run up and embrace her
But I'm ashamed to face her
Just tell her Jim said hello
I'd like to pour out my heart
But I don't know where to start
I'd like to tell her
What I'm really feeling but
Just tell her Jim and she'll know
Don't tell her I'm feeling blue
That's just between me and you
Don't say I'm thinking of her
Don't tell her I still love her
Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who stilled the water
Who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself
And you can look at others differently
From Galilee
My momma taught me how to pray
Before I reached the age of seven
When I'm down on my knees
That's when I'm closest to Heaven
Daddy lived his life, two kids and a wife
Well you do what you must do
But he showed me enough of what it takes
To get me through, oh yeah
Put your hand in the hand
Of the man from Galilee, oh yeah
Anyone could fall in love with you
Anyone who knows you as I do
And I love you my darling
Anyone could lose his heart like me
Anyone who has eyes that can see
Anyone could fall in love like me
You're the star I reached for
You're a dream so rare
You're my greatest treasure
Nothing can compare
Anyone could want you for his own
Anyone not only mine alone
I'll be there when all your dreams are broken
To answer your unspoken prayer, oh
When the little things you're doing, ooh, don't turn out right
Don't you worry darling I'll be there
There whenever you need to know that there is someone who cares, oh yeah!
So if your new love isn't your true love
Don't you worry darling, I'll be there
When the snow is on the roses
When the bluebird's flown away
In my arms I will remember
All the love we shared today
In my arms we will remember
When everyone thought the world was flat
Columbus said "It's round"
He went down in history
And America was found
Cause he had confidence
A little thing called confidence
There's no job too immense when you've got confidence
With a "C" and an "O" and an "N" and an "F"
And an "I" and a "D" and an "ENCE"
Put them all together and what have you got confidence
You'll be surprised what you can do
If you will only try
Remember the tortoise and the hare
Who had that famous race
The speedy hare wound up nowhere
And slow poke took first place
How do you know that you can't ride
A rainbow in the sky
All we need is confidence
The day that we wed
You blessed us and said
"May heaven bestow you grace"
There in that holy place
We shared our first embrace
Our cottage was small
But richer than all
The palaces of the king
All day the birds would sing
Our hearts were filled with spring
Padre, padre
What happened to our love so cruel?
Padre, oh padre
In my grief I turn to you
Then he came along
And sang her his song
And won her with honey lies
He of the fiery eyes
Now it's not her that cries
So I kneel and pray
The hours away
And weary my heart has grown
Wondering where love has flown
Counting my beads alone
Please tell me how such things can be
Pray for my love and me
I was born in Macon Georgia
They kept my daddy over in Macon jail
He told me if you keep your hands clean
You won't hear them bloodhounds on your trail
Well I fell in with bad companions
Robbed a man, oh up in Tennessee
They caught me way up in Nashville
They locked me up and threw away the key
I washed my hands in muddy water
Washed my hands, but they didn't come clean
Tried to do what my daddy told me
But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream
Well I asked the judge now when's my time up
He said son, oh you know we won't forget
If you try just to keep your hands clean
We might just make a good man of you yet
Oh I couldn't wait to get my time up
I broke out, broke out of Nashville jail
I just crossed the state-line of Georgia
Well I can hear those bloodhounds on my trail
Do you or don't you love me
Such an easy question
Why can't I get an answer
Tell me, will you or won't you need me
All you do is give a sigh
And beat around the bush
Can it be that you're too shy
To give yourself a little old push
Can you or can't you tell me yes
It's such an easy question
Young as a circus parade, it's a wonderful world
Pretty as pink lemonade, it's a wonderful world
Life is a carnival, live it for all your worth
You are the star of the greatest show on earth
This big wide world is a clown with his nose painted red
A rainbow colored balloon's dancing high overhead
It's everyone's oyster, step up get your pearl
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world
I used to laugh when I should cry
I used to let these feelings pass me by
But now that I believe them
I got no-one to leave them to me
You see I traded love for what I thought must be free
So I confess my loneliness
And I guess I've lost the best of the year
That I have lost it through my fingers like a golden breath of air
If I cared I wouldn't be singing this love song of the year
I know that time cannot erase the days
Love is past and I've gone away
From now on I'll make it very clear
Because I don't want to write
Another love song of the year
It's a lonely song and not too clear
But to me it's very dear
I guess this song can only be
My feelings went out in the sea of love
To me this has got to be the love song of the year
I used to laugh I used to cry
I used to laugh, these feelings passed me by
From now on I'll make it very clear because I don't want to write
Midnight's prayers so softly whispered in
A cathedral's candle light
Bring the message of the holidays
On a snowy Christmas night
Holly reeds and hidden mistletoe
Symbols of the season's might
Joyful faces everywhere you go
Give thanks for all you've been blessed with
And hold your loved ones tight
For you know the Lord's been good to you
Mother Nature wears a bridal gown
For the world is dressed in white
There's a silent glow that fills the earth
She sells sea shells by the seashore
But I know a girl who sells so much more
Queenie Wahine's Papaya rates higher than pineapple, pumpkin or poi
Please pick her papaya put Queenie Wahine in perfect perpetual joy
Though some people's palates prefer pickled salads
Plum pudding pink popcorn peach pie
Oh Queenie's papaya you'll truly desire
When that Queenie Wahine passes by
With eyes that hide the man within
You see behind the eyes of, other men
You've lived and died and come to life again
And now you stand alone at the crossroads of your mind
You've left your yesterdays behind..
But which road leads you to tomorrow?
Charro
You've turned your back on yesterday
Betrayed a man who swore he'd make you pay
For when you left you took his pride away
You know he'll never let you break away so easily
You'll have to fight, before you're free
But how much more time can you borrow?
Now in a single moment your past grows dim
One thought goes racing across your mind
You ride to meet the woman you stole from him
Oh no!, Charro don't go!
Charro don't go!!
There's something hanging, in the wind
Your past is catching up and closing in
You've been halfway to hell and back again
And now you laugh in the devil's face
With your last breath
You'll run a race with life and death
But will you live to see tomorrow?
If I had my life to live over
I know just what I'd like to be
A pampered pet of a rich brunette
Sitting on my mama's knee
Someone to love me, someone to care
Rub-a-dub dubble little fingers through my hair
I need a dog's life
What a life, that's good enough for me
That's good enough for me
If I had a bone to be picking
I'd be picking chicken or a steak
Curled up there in an easy chair
Man, that won't be hard to take
I'll always be faithful, that's what I'd be
Never bite a hand that feeds me, no siree
I'd find me a pink little poodle
And lose my noodle over her
I chase her around all over town
Just to ruffle up her fur
Nuzzle her muzzle, a holding her paw
Greatest case of puppy loving you ever saw
It's called a dog's life
You heard me say it now
Girls on the beaches commit a sin
If they don't show yards and yards of skin
Preceding message to you has been
Through the courtesy of the Fort Lauderdale Chamber Of Commerce
Maybe your yen is for tennis courts
Maybe romancing is in your thoughts
Enjoy all outdoor and indoor sports
Any male in Fort Lauderdale who is not pursuing a cute female
Will automatically land in jail
That's the law in Fort Lauderdale
Pretty girls eighteen to twenty-three
If their technique is not what it should be
Get love instruction for free from me
No-one's in a hurry
No-one seems to worry
Why they're all so happy is very clear
Every day siesta, every night fiesta
I think I'm gonna like it here
All this lovely scenery
There's more to it than greenery
I know a chance for romance is always near
Mission bells are ringing, everybody's singing
I think I'm gonna like it hear
The sound of laughter from every doorway
Sweet music floating across the square
It seems to say things are going better
Your troubles like bubbles will soon disappear in the air
Down to my last peso, but I'm not afraid to say so
I feel just like a brave, Spanish cavalier
I don't care where we go, so lead on "mi amigo"
Melodias, lapieras
I don't care where we go, so lead on" mi amigo"
I am not a wise man neither am I a fool
But what I am, the way the good Lord made me
Though I need you more than you may ever understand
I can't wear a face that will betray me
Oh, if you're gonna love me, love the life I lead
Need the things I need, don't try to change me
If you're gonna take me, take me for what I am
I can't be another man, I can't be free
'Cos the life I lead is the life I lead
Money in my pocket never seems to last too long
I've gambled on the way and drowned my sorrows
Though God knows, I can't pretend it's better on my own
I can't promise you a new tomorrow
If you're gonna love me, love the life I lead
'Cos the life I
A rose grows wild in the country
A tree grows tall as the sky
The wind blows wild in the country
And part of the wild, wild country, am I
Wild, wild, like the deer and the dove
Wild and free is this land that I love
A dream grows wild in the country
A love grows tall as the sky
A heart beats wild in the country
And here with a dream in my heart
Part of the wild, wild country, am I
For the millionth and the last time
Darling, let me hold you tight
One more kiss, and then I promise
I will say my last goodnight
Though your lips are so inviting
And I know I'll want to stay
Give me one more kiss to dream on
And I'll be on my way
It seems a million or so kisses ago
We said goodnight at your door
I didn't get far 'cause here we are
And I'm still begging for more
While the millionth and the last star
Slowly disappears from sight
Let me kiss you good-night
Let me kiss you good night
I need Jesus to guide me every day
As I'm travellin' along this rough and narrow way
Though afflictions fill my soul
I'm determined to make the goal
I've gotta have Jesus 'cause I just can't make it by myself
Every day I pray (pray) pray (pray)
Pray (pray) pray (pray)
I pray (pray) pray (pray
Pray pray pray
Pray and ask the Lord Jesus
Don't leave me by myself
Every mornin' through the years I pray
You know I've got to have Jesus
I just can't it by myself
By myself
Baby, you know me well
You know I mean what I say
Before I say farewell
I'll give you just another day
You'd better find out what's happening
Find out what's happening before long
If you don't find out what's happening
You're gonna find out that I'm gone
Tell me what you're gonna do?
You'd better make up your mind
It all depends on you
I'm leaving you behind
Find out what's happening before long, no, no
You're gonna find out that I'm gone, gone, yeah
Baby, you know it's true
We've been through thick and thin
But if you don't come through
You won't ever see me again
Find out what's happening before long, oh Lord
You'd better find
(Find out what's happening, find out what's happening)
You better find out
If you don't, what's happening
(Find out what's happening)
How many stars are in the sky
I'll never know
What fire lights a firefly
What happens to this heart of mine
Each time you hold my hand
Sometimes the things we love the most
We never understand
I never thought these eyes would see
An angel's glow
What miracle brought you to me
I hope I never ever love anyone this much again
I can't take it anymore
I've been hurt before
Never ever quite like this time
What will become of me when you're no longer here?
If I can't stop loving you
What am I to do?
You'll be free but where will I be?
Now that I'm used to love, how can I stand alone?
Now that love has come and gone
Like the ending of a song
A song my lonely heart keeps singing
Where do I go from here? Will I get over you?
If so, next time I'll be smart
I'll know before I start
A heart that don't care, don't get broken
Never ever, never again, never again
Come on kids from eight to eighty
Hey there mister bring your lady
There's a big show on the inside
It's carnival time
Popcorn, peanuts and cotton candy
Pink lemonade that's dan-dan-dandy
Be a big shot for a dollar
Roustabouts roustabouting
And there's happy shouts, children shouting
If you've got doubts quit your doubting'
There's thrills, it's spice
It's cheap at half the price
So don't be bashful, buy a ticket
Get the habit never kick it
Hit the band there, don't just stand there
You offered me a penny for my thoughts
And I told you then that woman won't stay caught
But you turned and loved her anyway
She broke your heart and all I've got to say
It's your baby, you rock it
It's your heartache, you bought it
You made the bed you sleeping in
And I'm tired of hearing about it friend
Well you cried upon my shoulder like a baby
I'm sorry 'bout your troubles and your lady
But she done you like she done me
And I've used up all my sympathy
It's your baby you, rock it
In a little while you're leaving
Starting on the journey home
Soon I'll be alone, the one who loves you
La la la la la, somewhere in the heart of Rome
I'll make a wish in every fountain
Say a prayer that you'll return
Minutes I'll be counting
May the fire of love still burn
I'll keep your picture by my pillow
And pretend I'm not alone
Make believe that you are with me
La la la la la, in the heart of Rome
Suddenly the tears are falling
As we hear the whistle blow
Hold me very close before you leave me
I'm going to where the desert sun is
Go where I know the fun is
Go where the harem girls dance
Go where there's love and romance
Out on the burning sands, in some caravan
I'll find adventure, while I can
To say the least, go on, go east young man
Go east young man, go east young man
You'll feel like a sheik, so rich and grand
With dancing girls at your command
Go eat and drink and feast, go east young man
I'm going to go where the night's enchanted
Go where those dreams are granted
When paradise starts calling, into some tent I'm crawling
I hear those desert drums, and when nighttime comes
Then I'll make love the way I planned
As I read the letters that you wrote to me
Well it's you, it's you that I'm thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love
I miss you darling more and more everyday
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love
As I think of the past, all the pleasures that we had
As I watch the mating of the doves
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye
Now, I'm a U.S. Male cause I was born
In a Mississippi town on a Sunday morn
Now Mississippi just happens to occupy a place
In the southeastern portion of this here United States
Now that's a matter of fact, buddy
And you know it well
So I just call myself the U.S. Male
That's M-A-L-E, son. That's me!
Now I said all that to say all this
I've been watching' the way
You've been watching' my miss
For the last three weeks you been hot on her trail
And you kinda upset this U.S. Male
You touch her once with your greasy hands
I'm gonna stretch your neck like a long rubber band
She's wearin' a ring that I bought her on sale
And that makes her the property of this U.S. Male
You better not mess with the U.S. Male my friend
The U.S. Male gets mad, he's gonna do you in
You know what's good for yourself, son
You better find somebody else, son
Don't tamper with the property of the U.S. Male
Through the rain and the heat and the sleet and the snow
The U.S. Male is on his toes
So quit watching' my woman, cuz that ain't wise
You ain't pullin' no wool over this boy's eyes
I catch you 'round my woman, champ
I'm gonna leave your head 'bout the shape of a stamp
Kinda flattened out, so you'll do well
To quit playin' games with this U.S. Male
Tell me guitar
Aw yeah
Now sock it to me one time, baby
All right, now I'm gonna tell it like it is, son
I catch you messing' 'round with that woman of mine
I'm gonna lay one on ya. You're talking' to the U.S. Male
The American U.S. Male
I've been yearnin' for a little romance
I want to know when you're gonna give me a chance
Love me honey, tell me you're mine
Doncha' think it's time
I've been yearning for a sweet embrace
Rub my hair till I'm a total disgrace
Kiss me honey make me feel so fine
I don't wanna walk without you
Walking right by my side
It hurts me to see you talkin'
With the other guy
I get so warm when you touch my cheek
You thrill me so much that I can hardly speak
Love me honey, when you feel so fine
To any other guy
Kiss me honey, make me feel so fine
Build it up, knock it down
Hold it square, roll it around
Throw it in the air
Stick it in the ground
But it's too bad, I can't get mad
'Cause I'm a roustabout
Tie it loose, make it tight
If it's wrong, do it right
Makes me kinda feel
Like I wanna fight
Orders all day and half the night from the boss T
That guy just doesn't wanna see one minute lost
Stack it up, in the rear
Better still bring it here
Wanna take it out, stick it in his ear
A handyman is all I am around this place
Every time I turn around, he's right up in my face
Bring it in, bring it out
When I'm slow, boy he shouts
Getting awful tired, running in and out
I play the song, it was our own
Your photograph's by my side
I know I can't forget you
So I don't even try
The note you left is in my hand
I read again what you say
You're sorry but you love him
And you've both gone away
This is the story of a man
Whose world has fallen apart
And it's the story
That is breaking my heart
An open fire, our favorite chair
I get a book from the shelf
But the words I am reading
Could apply to myself
Yes, it's the story that is breaking my heart
A poor man wants the oyster
A rich man wants the pearl
But the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world
Come on let's sing, sing brother sing
'Cos the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
The rich man wants the princess
The poor man just wants a girl
A poor man wants to be a rich man
A rich man wants to be a king
Of the whole wide world
I said, "Three corn patches about four cotton fields away"
I said, "Three corn patches about four cotton fields away
Lives the prettiest girl in the whole darn U.S.A", I said a
She's got big brown eyes and long black wavy hair
She's so beautiful, people, it don't seem fair
Well, I've been to Chicago, been to New Orleans
Yes, I've been to Chicago, been to New Orleans
But I'd rather see my baby, workin' in her old blue jeans
She keeps a big bulldog out in the yard all night
Well he barks like he's bare, but he don't bite
I said, "Three"
Oh, it won't seem like christmas, oh, without you
Far too many miles are between
But if I get the one thing I'm wishing for
Well then I'll se you tonight in my dreams
Seems a long time since we've been together
It was just about to this time of the year
Looks like it's gonna be snowy weather
How I wish that you could be here
But it won't seem like christmas, oh, without you
But if I get the one thing that I'm wishing for
Then I'll see you tonight in my dreams
In the distance I hear sleigh bells ringing
The holly is so pretty this year
And the carol that somebody's singing
Reminds me of our christmas last year
All the rides are over and done
It's late and no prizes are left to be won
The rides are closed, it's the end of the day
The horses are moving away
Yes the fair's moving on
And I'll soon be gone
Remember the love that we've known
But I won't leave you long
It's the last time you'll be on your own
The music has ended, the carousel's still
The horses in boxes with the big Ferris wheel
The canvass and glitter are safely on board
The trailers will soon hit the road
Remember the love that we had
I'm coming back so please don't be sad
At dawn I'll be gone but I'll soon return
Till then the fair's moving on
You've got to walk that lonesome valley
Well you gotta go by yourself
Well there ain't nobody else gonna go there for you
You gotta go there by yourself
Now mother walked that lonesome valley
Now mother walked, she walked it by herself
Well there ain't nobody else could ever walk it for her
She had to walk it, she had to walk it by herself
Now father walked that lonesome valley
Now father walked it, he walked it by himself
Nobody else could walk it for him
Well he had to walk it, he had to walk it by himself
Now John was a baptist
He was some folk say he was a Jew
He wrote that holy holy bible
The bible tells you, it plainly tells you
That he was, that he was a preacher too
Mexico, Mexico
They've got muchas, mucha-chas, amigos
Latin features, never saw such adorable creatures
Love to dig, ooh the nights here
We live it up and love it up amigo
Life begins when you're in Mexico
You never order, water
When you order south of the border
In to kiss a lovely senorita
Ooh the samba, la bamba
I'll go where you go
They've got muchas mucha-chas, amigos
Never saw such adorable creatures
Somewhere out in empty space
Long before the human race
Something stirred
A vast and timeless source began
Intelligence was born and then
There was the Word
Powers filled the universe
Matter formed and broke the curse
Of nothingness
Love became an ageless soul
Nature reached her highest goal
And breathed the breath of life
Everlasting life
Well, creatures come from out of sight
Daylight came from in the night
And all was good
Life became a master plan
Love produced a perfect man
That understood
The image of the Maker's word
Worshiped him with all he had
But then one day
From in the depths an evil seed
Grew and manufactured greed
That changed the way of life
Oh, the loving power looked and saw
Inside the heart of man a flaw
Began to grow
Well, the fires of Hell began to burn
And so He sent his chosen son
To let us know
That love had surely made us all
And hate would surely make us fall
So from the cross
Well He showed the world that dreadful day
That love could be the only way
Or all is lost of life
For life is love
And love is life
Slowly but surely I'm gonna wear you down
Slowly but surely I'm gonna bring you round
To my way of thinking, my way of kissing, my way of loving
Slowly but surely, I'm gonna make you mine
I ain't gonna rush yeah, I'll let you meditate
Though I wanna crush yeah my arms will have to wait
I'll just take it easy, so nice and easy, real cool really
Oh yeah! Mm-mm, I've got a feeling I'm not wasting my time
Oh yeah! When you get the message it's going to be fine
Slowly but surely, the table's gonna turn
Slowly but surely, your lips are gonna burn
For what you've been missing is my kind of kissing, my kind of loving
I'm gonna make you mine
Janie, Janie, Janie, Janie, Jane Jane
Down in the alley, just you and me
We're going bowling till half past three
Just rocking and reeling, we'll get that feeling
Down in the alley, oh baby Gee
I plant you now and dig you later
'Cause you're a fine sweet potato
We'll have a ball and that ain't all
The clock is striking a mournful sound
This time of evening my love comes down
That's when I'm missing your kind of kissing
Down in the alley, that's where I'll be
Alright, oh
Down in the alley, we sure have fun
We just get started 'bout half past one
So if you're 'round just come on down
Down in the alley and you will see
Janie, Janie, Janie, Janie, Jane
Underneath the foliage, in its bower set
Loveliest of the flowers of spring
Blooms the violet
(Violet, violet, flower of N.Y.U.)
We will ever sing thy praise
To thee we'll ere be true
(We'll be true)
The Sandman comes to my house late each night
But it's way in the morning before he turns out my life
It's times like this my darling I can see
If I were you I'd know that I love me
The great snowman I've been called by all
But it looks like this time I'm going to fall
Ooh If I were you I'd know that I love me
Wind and rain and storm closing in on me
I've walked the streets alone with my self sympathy
Can you hear me saying hopefully
I just thought I heard a small voice crying
Looked again and saw that it was me
I feel like a little boy denying
That he fears the night because he can't see
Then a larger thought said, "Stop your crying
Don't be scared to search 'cause you may find
Fate holds out a candle for your footsteps
Time rolls back the shadows of your mind
It's a long, long lonely night
You can make the morning if you try
Oh, we can make the morning if we try
Girl, we can make the morning you and I
Together, together, together
Loneliness is a darkness' first companion
Spend the night alone and faith may bend
Share it all and see how fear starts fading
Chase away the shadows with a friend
Dawn's elusive light is just beginning
Now the day can push away the night
Dreams can make the sun feel much brighter
Hope creates a foothold for the light
Where do you come from?
Tell me who you are
Do you come from another world
Or from some distant star?
Are you what you seem?
Are you real
Are you standing there
Or is it just a dream?
Tell me more about yourself
Do you feel the way I feel?
Are you just a vision
Or are you really real?
Angel won't you say?
Tell me all that there is to know
And tell me that you'll stay
Earth boy dream of angel
Angel she be sweet and make him have happy heart
In land of love
Angel dream of earth boy, earth boy who'll be true
And love her till sun grow cold in land of love
Angel walk on street
Earth boy walking too
All at once they meet
Oo-oo-oo dreams come true
Now best part of story
Like two doves in land of love we will always be
Happy angel is you
Happy earth boy is me
Angel dream of earth boya
Angel dream of earth boy
Had a dream about you baby, had a dream about me and you
Had a dream and woke up crying
Well I can roll but I just can't rock
And the time's going by, tick-tock
For the heart, I just can't love no-one but you
Well I'm high and dry and lonely, I'm as lonely as can be
And I stare out of my window
Well I can play but I just can't win
And the weather's looking dim
For the heart I just can't love no-one but you
For the heart
Well, for the heart
Yes, for the heart
Hawaii, U.S.A., Hawaii U.S.A
We're flying, coming your way
Aloha, Hawaii U.S.A
Gee it's great, to be in that fiftieth state
The land of enchanted dreams
What an isle, where it's heaven tropical style
Where love weaves a spell, it seems
Gee what fun, just to swim and surf in the sun
While the trade winds caress the sea
What a sight, those exotic scenes of delight
Are waiting for you and me
Hawaii, U.S.A  Hawaii  U.S.A  Hawaii  U.S.A
Well she's a
Earth quaking, hip shaking, soul breaking, love making
Machine, hey hey!!
She's a mad stalking, smooth talking, slow walking cat
You know what I mean, hey hey!!
She'll wrap those arms around you
Like a grizzly bear
She'll kiss you every fifteen minutes
And lets you up for air
Cause she's a earth quaking, hip shaking
Soul breaking, love making, machine
All right!!
Wild moving, smooth grooving, clock ticking, love making
She's a real breezing, rough squeezing, hell teasing cat
She'll leer and make you like it
Sweet as she can be
She'll make you blow your mind before
You count to one-two-three
Tonight I'm alone without you my dear
It seems that there's a longing for you still
Oh but I just keep it there so I won't be alone
In our little cabin on the hill
Oh someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
To listen to the rain beat on our window pane
Guadalajara, Guadalajara
Tienes el alma de provinciana
Hueles a limpio, a rosa temprana
A verde jara fresca del río
Son mil palomas tu caserío
Sabes a pura tierra mojada
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay! Colomitos lejanos
Ay! Ojitos de agua hermanos
Ay colomitos inolvidables
Inolvidables como las tardes
En que la lluvia, desde la loma
Nos nos dejaba ir hasta Zapopan
Ay mis hermanos ay-ay-ay Mexicano
Well a hundred years from now I won't be crying
A hundred years from now I won't be blue
My heart will have to forget that we ever met
But I won't care a hundred years from now
I'll never forget sweetheart the night you told me
That you couldn't live without my love somehow
That's all in the past I knew it wouldn't last
Relax, kick your shoes off baby
Relax, here we are alone
Relax, if the phone rings, let it
Just forget it, we're not at home
Cut loose, let your hair down honey
Unwind, turn the lights down low
Relax, let's uncork the stopper
Come to papa, come on let's go
Defrost, your charms
There's only the two of us here
Come in my arms
And make yourself comfortable dear
Relax, let's get cozy baby
Come on, let your concrete crack
Cut loose, when the knock's invited
Don't you fight it, come on relax
Cut loose, life is worth the livin'
When you're givin', come on relax
Relax.....mmmmm....let loose...mmmm...defrost....mmmmm...
Baby it's wrong, wrong as can be
To try and tie a guy like me
I could never settle down in a little sleepy town
There is so much world to see
Sure would be happy for a while
But then we'd have to part
When tears replace your loving smile
Well, I don't want to be the guy
Who has to break your heart
So, here's where it ends, not lovers but friends
Though your lips are tempting me
Maybe I'm a fool and yet
This wanderer just can't forget
For me, there's so much world to see
Yeah, yeah
There's a brand new day on the horizon
Everything's gonna be just fine
And the whole world's gonna be mine
I'm gonna tell old trouble, he'd better be moving on
Happiness is going to take his place around here from now on
The old dark clouds are gonna roll away
The sun is gonna shine
I'm gonna tell old heartaches, pack his bags and go
I've decided that I don't want him hanging around no more
Don't you know I said everything's gonna be just fine
Cause the whole world's gonna be mine
I'm gonna chase away those blues till they're out of sight
And I guarantee you honey they won't be coming back
Well don't you know I said everything's gonna be all right
I know my luck's gonna change, just you wait and see
Starting tomorrow only good things in life are going to come to me
I told her to leave me alone
That's what she's done
Just what she's done
And a house built for two, ain't a home
When it's lived in by one, one lonely one
And I can no longer hear footsteps
Come right down the hall
Here come the teardrops
Bitter they are, harder they fall
She caught me lying
Then she caught a train
And I caught a fever
Walking home in the rain, oh yeah
But it's over and I'm done
She left me once and for all
Give me the right
To hold you tonight
The tears that I've cried over you
You can't say no
When I need you so
I want you back in my arms
If you looked deep in your heart
Like I looked into mine
You'll find that nothing has changed
Our love was there all the time
Why make me plead
For something you need
I want to bring back the thrill
I'll send you red roses by the dozen
I'll call you sweet little things like turtle dove
I'll whisper pretty things in your ear
The kind of things a girl likes to hear
Baby, if you'll give me all of your love
I'll bring you pounds and pounds of chocolate candy
To prove it's you that I've been thinking of
Tear up all the pictures I own of every pretty girl I've ever known
I'll take you dancing every night until you're ready to drop
I'll kiss your sweet red cherry lips until you holler stop
Every night I'll serenade you 'neath your window
If you need me just a whistle and I won't need a shove
I'll hug you squeeze you tight as I can
It ain't going to be no one-night stand
Every night I'll serenade you ‘neath your window
If you will give me, if you will give me all your love
Gently your eyes met mine
Tender, trusting, true
Gently your hand took mine
Thrilled me through and through
Gently, oh so gently
Gentle as the dawn
Our true love was born
Gently your lips kissed mine
As we strolled along
Gently your heart touched mine
Young and warm and strong
Gently the hour is near
When true loves have to part
Gently we'll meet again
One more kiss, sweetheart
That's what you get for loving me
Everything we had is gone, you can see
Now don't you shed a tear for me
I ain't the love you thought I'd be
I've had a hundred just like you
But don't be blue I'll have a thousand before I'm through
Now there you go, you're cryin' again
You should have known how things would end
But then some day when your poor heart is on the mend
I just might pass this way again
I remember as a child I used to hear
Music that they played Lord with a feel
Some call it folk, some call it soul
But people let me tell you it was rock and roll
I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
Every day when I got home I turned on my radio
Listening to the music that my idols made
I knew every single record the DJ's played
A honky tonk a Hound Dog, a Johnny B. Goode
Chain Gang, Love Is Strange, Knock On Wood
I was born to love the beat, I was made for rock and roll
Some thought it was a fad, thought that it would pass
But the younger generation knew it would last
Time's gone by, the beat goes on
But every time I hear it, Lord, it takes me home
Mother played recordings of Beethoven's Fifth
Mozart's sonatas down the classical Liszt
My papa loved to listen to those country songs
While I was in the back room rocking on
I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my
Soul
I got over Charlotte Thompson, Goldie Johnson
Lord they done me wrong
I took it hard with Peggy Harper
She hurt me bad, but not for long
There's just one I remember
Makes me feel funny down inside
I'd trade 'em all for just one hour
Of Susan when she tried
No there's never been a woman
Who could make me weak inside
And give me what I needed
Like Susan when she tried
It gets worse in the summer
When the nights are hot and long
And it's bad in December
When they play those Christmas songs
So if you ask me and I don't tell you
Bet your sweet bottom dollar I lied
Cause there's never been one better
Than Susan when she tried
Earth Angel, Earth Angel
Will you be mine
My darling dear
Love you all the time
I'm just a fool
A fool in love with you
The one I adore
Love you forever and ever more
I fell for you
And I knew
The vision of your lov-loveliness
I hoped and I prayed that someday
That I'd be the vision of your hap-happiness
Oh,Oh
Please be mine
Come praise the Lord for he is good
Mmm, come join in love and brotherhood
We'll hear the word and bring our gifts of bread and wine
And we'll be blessed beneath the sign
So let us pray together, pray together
Pray with the one mighty voice (heavenly voice)
And let us sing together, sing together
Pray and we'll rejoice (we'll rejoice)
When strangers reach out for your hand (for your hand)
Respond to them and understand (heaven obeyed to understand)
We'll rise as one to calm the storm outside the gate (calm the storm)
With faith in him we'll never leave (never leave)
Pray and we'll rejoice
(We'll rejoice, we'll rejoice)
The love of God is on our side (love is, love is on our side)
We have the strength to move the tide (we'll move the tide)
The world will say so, there'll be peace and love for all (love for all)
And we must give our brothers love
Love for all, love for all to the Lord
We'll rejoice love for all to the Lord
We'll rejoice for the Lord
Flip, flop with kay-eye
What a cutie pie I see
Hoop shoopa doo-wah
Lips of honey that's for me
Shim sham shimmie
Wanna howl and shout, there's no doubt
I saw you standing against the wall
I whistled and I gave my all
Now don't tell me you don't fall
For that wolf call
Just a little kiss will put me in a whirl
I'll never whistle baby at another girl
You love me well we'll have a ball
Why do you try to stall
Beyond the reef where the sea is dark and cold
My love has gone from me and my dreams grow cold
There'll be no tears, there'll be no regretting
Will she remember me, will she forget?
I'll send a thousand flowers
Where the trade winds blow
I'll send my lonely heart for I love her so
Some day I know, she'll come back again to me
Till then my heart will be beyond the reef
Oh, I love only one girl, the one I got my arms around
I love only one girl, one in every town
In Paris there is Mimi, and when the moon is bright
I love to take her walking, along the Seine each night
I kiss her on the left bank, then I kiss her on the right
I'm proud of my Brunhilde, in Frankfurt on the Rhine
Oh she's a lot of woman and all of her is mine
Oh she can lift a Steinway as easy as a stein
In Naples there's Maria how she can cook and flirt
You can't beat her lasagna, I eat until I hurt
And then she tops it off with "amore" for dessert
Line up girls, I'll show you what to do
This boat will sparkle like a diamond when we get through
By the numbers there is not much time
We're gonna start an assembly line
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
You get the sandpaper, you get the pails
You get the hammer baby, you get the nails
You get the paint, you get the brush
Because we're gonna give it the special touch
We got a magic potion that will help us win
I don't know how to spell it but dip right in
Glocoseoxytonicphosphate, it's the latest scoop
But that's all right girls you can call it "Goop"
Work the sandpaper, hammer that nail
Tote that paintbrush and lift that pail
Get a rhythm going, nice and easy
Come on and use a little elbow greasy
O.K. Girls, we're all through
I'm going to tell you what we're gonna do
We'll fall right down and have some fun
And I'm gonna kiss you all one by one
Now once it was told to me, we're born with a magic key
It opens the door to miracles of spring
It takes you to wishing wells, to ice cream and carousels
And yet this magic key won't unlock a thing
Unless you have a happy, you have a happy
Have a happy, warm smiling face
I start believing, in believing
Let your address be sunshine place
There's love and there's joy I'm told
Much more than your heart can hold
It's there like the ring you'd grab on a merry-go-round
The world isn't half as gray with friends on a rainy day
But people keep away when you wear a frown, you've got
To have a happy, you have a happy
Have a happy warm smiling face
Start believing, in believing
Suppose no rose would ever grow again
Suppose no brook would ever flow again
Suppose no star should ever glow again
Suppose you didn't love me
Suppose there were no bees or butterflies
Suppose no bird should ever cross the skies
Suppose the sun should never never rise
It's impossible to imagine a world without a star
But imagining no you is more impossible, by far
Suppose the Springtime never should arrive
Suppose the tall green trees should not survive
Suppose I had no wish to be alive
Hear that old train whistle
Howling in the night
If that flyer's southbound
Everything will be all right
I'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now
I'm gonna get back home somehow
Don't nobody tell me
Baby's been untrue
If she's been unfaithful
I don't know what I'll do
Never thought that I could miss her so
I never thought I could , now I know
The sound of the old train whistle
Makes me want to cry
Reminds me of that lonely feeling
When I said goodbye
Every time I see the sun rise
Or a mountain that's so high
Just by seeing is believing
I don't need to question why
When I see a mighty ocean
That rushes to the shore
If I ever had cause to doubt Him
I don't doubt Him anymore
Oh seeing, seeing, seeing is believing
And I see Him everywhere
In the mountains, in the valley
Yes I know my God is there
Oh, in time I look above me
See the stars that fill the sky
How could there be any question
Only God can reach that high
I will be true
No matter what they may say
Although you're far, far away
Each night I pray
All day I'll say silent prayers
That when I open my door
I'll find you there
Somehow I feel
That someday we'll meet again
Don't ask me how
It's something I can't explain
Until the day
I give up all hope of you
Assure yourself this, I'll do
Oh the neons are a gleaming and the gamblers are a dreaming
Oh it's night life, yeah! night life
The chips are a spilling and it's time to make a killing
Oh the pockets are a-burning and the money flies
With dice roll a-turning and you'll hit snakes eyes
You can't be a quitter when you're caught up in the glitter of
Night life night life
There're long legged women who will take you for a trimming yes it's night life
Oh night life
Their lips taste like honey but they're out to spend your money
Yes it's night life. Oh yeah!
Just roll that seven and you'll hear them shriek
When seven come eleven it's a lucky streak
You can't beat the drama, the excitement and the glamour
Of the night life, I said that night life
So place your bet, come on make your play
Though you may regret it at the break of day
I said you can't be a quitter when you're caught up in the glitter of
Yeah! that night life, good old night life
Night life, yes, yes, night life, oh night life
I remember how your eyes used to light up
Over promises that I made
But for the first time in my life
I know now how it feels to be afraid
I don't know what I'd do if you go away
This would sure be one lonely old town
For a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love coming down
Love coming down
I remember all the times you told me
Love's all that matters to you
And looking back now, wondering how I believed
I had things more important to do
I can see how I must have looked to you
Like some fool on a merry-go-round
And that a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love going down
Love going down
Can't you see how everything I've learned
Would just be wasted if you leave me
If you just give one more try
I swear I'll always be here when you need me
If you can find it in your heart to forgive me
I'll try to keep both my feet on the ground
But if a man's so busy going up in the world
Here's another dime for you, Mr. Songman
Sing the loneliness of broken dreams away, if you can
Yes it's only me and you, Mr. Songman
Take away the night sing away my hurt, Mr. Songman
In your ivory covered house, safe behind your walls of glass
You keep staring back at me like a memory from the past
Won't you sing me away to a summer night
Let me hold you in my arms again
I know memory's not re-living
But at least it's not the end
Here's another dime for you Mr. Songman
Won't you take away the night, sing away my hurt, Mr. Songman
Let me hold her in my arms again
When you're asleep beside me, I watch you lying there
Your hand upon the pillow and moonlight in your hair
I get the warmest feeling, so good I almost cry
I kiss your sleeping lips and say I'll love you 'till I die
Oh, girl of mine, you make my day
One sunny smile and all the clouds just roll away
Eyes deep as the sea seem to say to me
Our love will always be
So, girl of mine, turn out the light
And in my arms together we'll make sweet love tonight
Down life's golden road and you'll always know
I love you, girl of mine
Sometimes I know I hurt you when things ain't goin' right
I walk away and leave you to face the lonely night
I wouldn't blame you, darling, if you walked out on me
But I return to find you there still waiting patiently
I can't conceal the tender feeling
Now that you are close to me
I look at you with tender feeling
And can't help kiss you tenderly
I offer you a true devotion
All life through my love I vow
For this is real, this sweet emotion
This tender feeling I have now
Somehow I knew from the moment our lips first met
You'd be the girl I could never forget
No other love could be appealing
I loved you right from the start
And with each kiss I'll keep revealing
The tender feeling in my heart
Are you sincere when you say "I love you"
Are you sincere when you say you love me too
And are you really mine every day, all the time
I've gotta know which way to go
Will our love grow, are you sincere
Honey, are you sincere when you say you love me too
Your lips, your eyes, your soft sweet sights
I feel that I've known you forever
Your style, your touch, you're just too much
I know that this never happened to me
Don't have to see anymore than I see
Your face so rare, beyond compare
And ever and ever
Well I remember when I was as children
The time the people used to treat the neighbor like a fellow man
And all their singing and big prayer meetings
When a man was proud to walk up and shake his neighbor's hand
Oh you talk about the good times
Talk about the good times
Oh if you ever needed help a friend was there
Some good neighbor
Help lift your burden
Mmm, and the simple joys of life a friend would share
Times are harder and the people are changing
Now most folks couldn't tell you who their neighbors are
All their guns are loaded, the front doors are bolted
Ain't this old world taking hate and fear just a little too far
I wish I could go back to the days I'm speaking of
When a friend would meet you
And a smile would greet you
What this old world needs now is a little old fashioned love
My granddaddy God rest his soul now
Well we had a big long talk together the day he died
Said son this world is full of hate and venom
And I can't wait to leave this old place and rest on the other side
Oh you talk about the good times, talk about the good times
I'm gonna see all the friends I knew in the good old days
We'll have a big hand shaking
And sit and talk together
Sit down by the river Jordan and sing our blues away
Don't ever take your eyes off me
Not even for a minute
'Cause like a panther I might pounce
And there'll be danger in it
I can be sneaky, fast as a snake
I strike like a cobra, make no mistake
And baby you'll be trapped, quick as a wink
It's animal instinct
Don't think that I won't pin you down
No matter how you plead it
I'm like a lion who's been caged
And you're the meat I'm needin'
Watch out I'll warn you, sharp as a hawk
I'm wild as a tiger, I prowl and I stalk
Because when a man feels thirst, he takes a drink
You better not be caught off guard
This wolf is on the search now
A leopard just can't change its spots
And I'm about to lurch now
I roar like the jungle, I fight tooth and nail
I just gotta get you, you'll fall without fail
I'm ready for the kill, I was right on the brink
It's animal instinct, animal instinct
The words of her promise
The flame of her faith
The love that would never drift away
Where did they go Lord, where did they go?
You know somehow forever
Slipped out of my hands
And my dreams ran away with the wind
Where did they go Lord, where did they go
You know sometimes I wish
I had lost her to another
Well but Lord she just walked off all alone
But all that is within me is the bitter just ending
And bewildered because her love is gone
Oh the passion I trusted
The truth that I leaned on
And the hope that would forever keep me strong
I cry out my questions
Oh, the answers are all gone
Where did they go Lord, tell me where did they go
You like to keep me dangling on a string
'Cause you know without you my life don't mean a thing
So I beg you
Please don't drag that string around, oh no
Well, what if it should break
Oh, tell me, what would I do then
Keep that string up off the ground
Oh, yeah, remember my heart is tied to the other end
Yes, I'm your puppet, my heart is in your hand
One twist of the wrist and I jump to your command
What would I do then
Baby, keep that string up off the ground
I feel inside me, as sure as anything
One day I'll mean more to you than a puppet on a string
Oh I will never forget the first night we met
Was love I was searching for
My heart beat faster and faster, oh so much faster
Faster than it did before
Juntos estaremos
Siempre por siempre
Junto a mi corazo'n
Siempre estara's
We'll be together, and love forever
Nothing can change our destiny
I knew the moment I kissed you, couldn't resist you
Together we belong
And then I knew in that moment just what this glow meant
True love had come along
We'll be together, ever and ever, close to my heart
You'll always be
This proud wild land where the wind blows free
Has always been a part of me
It's in my blood, I just can't get it out
For a hundred miles a man can see
And be about as wild as he wants to be
If he feels like shouting all he's got to do is shout
Where the purple mountains reach up high
And look like they're going to touch the sky
Where the canyon walls have stood for a million years
Where the days are hot, the nights are cold
The desert sand looks just like gold
These trails were carved in sweat and blood and tears
Where the painted desert as you pass by
Looks like a rainbow in the sky
The cactus blooms in the early morning sun
Where the nightwings sing and eagles fly
The clouds paint pictures in the sky
The coyotes howl tells you when the day is done
I'm coming home, this time I'm going to stay
I'm coming home and I am never going away
My feet are itching to get back home
I've had the desert fever since I've been gone
I need some loving so bad that I can't see
When a woman looks a man in the eye
You know it takes a man to satisfy
Thinking about them girls is killing me
I'm going home, going home
Going home, I'm going home
Going home, going home
Going home
There is no God, but God
I know this is true
God made everything
He made me, He made you
There'd be no birds
No planes to sail in the blue
Without his wondrous eyes
To see them through
They say God made land
And He gave it all to man
Yes I know He's mighty good and true
And He knows everything to do
So just you call on Him
And He will share His love with you
For God made everything
When I'm over you there'll be darkness where my soul has been
And no light will ever shine again when I'm o-over you
When you're leaving is over and there's not another tear to cry
In the silence of that last goodbye just remember, remember this
When I'm over you there'll be darkness, darkness, darkness where my soul has been
And no light will ever, ever shine again when I'm over you
This is my heaven
Being here with you
Make it last forever
It's a dream come true
Come to me now
And take my hand
This is the paradise I plan
You're like an angel
Sent from up above
Let's stay close together
You brought me heaven
When I shared your love
Here beneath the sky beside the sea
When you come to me
He's your uncle, not your dad
He's the best friend you ever had
So, come on, dig, dig, dig in until it hurts
Just remember Pearl Harbor
The Alamo and nothing could be worse
He's your favorite relative
And he needs a lot to live
So just bring, bring, bring everything until you bleed
And he'll send back what he don't need
If you're not in form, ten-forty's your salvation
By deprivation of temptation
Dark and blondes I hear are not deductible
Oh, say, can you see if there's anything left for me?
When he calls you as he may do
Don't be frightened, red white and blue
Just be thankful you don't live in Leningrad
If you're honest, you don't have to shake and shiver
The food is lousy up the river
It's give and take and he does all the taking
Life has two things you can't subtract
Death and taxes to be exact
So just pa-pa-patriotically declare
He's your uncle, he's your uncle, not your dad
One thought of you
My heart begins churning
I feel return
To a fountain of love
My lips and eyes
They ache to be near you
To hold you here
In my fountain of love
Never be blue
Should your world start sinking
Just come and drink
From my fountain of love
We'll build a new world off
On a high mountain
We'll live
On our fountain of love
There's a legend of a famous matador
Who went to meet El Toro
Though he fought as he had never done before
He could not beat, El Toro
The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame
They said time would never heal the many scars
Brought by the great, El Toro
And the bitterness that burned deep in his heart
Caused him to hate, El Toro
So one night, when no-one was in sight
The matador, went to settle the score
In the lonely fields, beneath the pale moonlight
He sought the bull, and they fought once more
When they found the matador, they saw him dying
He'd never see tomorrow
Now they say that on the spot where he was lying
Still walks the proud El Toro
Ho jump down, spin around, let's have a party
Look who's back, Stay Away Joe
Chock taw, chick a Shaw, going to drink me hearty
Welcome back, Stay Away Joe
Stay Away Joe they call me
Stay Away Joe, oh yeah
But if you need me call me
Hoop and a holler and I'll be there
Ho
Who keeps turning up like a bad penny
Take one guess, Stay Away Joe
Always finding trouble a-plenty
Oh my yes, I reckon you know
When two lips are right for the picking
Who crops up, Stay Away Joe
I love them and leave them screaming 'n kicking
Giddy up look at him look at him go
Walk down to the beach at sunset
Look as far as you can see
You will find that endless ocean
And that's how my love will always be
I bring you never ending, never ending
Never ending, never ending
Never ending, never ending love
Look up at the sky at midnight
Gaze up on the starlit view
Just as heaven has no boundaries
Neither does my love for you
Never ending love
I don't want to, I don't want to
I don't want to let you know how much I want you
Don't come near me, I don't trust you
I don't trust the way you thrill me when I touch you
I was happy free and easy, I could go around
And do the things that please me
I don't want to get tied down with a girl like you
I don't want to love you, but I do
Whenever I dance with the girl I love
My head goes 'round and 'round
When she's close to me
I can't stay on the ground
I never have a care
All night I'm so light
I walk right on the air
Oh let me, oh honey let me
Let me do what you know I love to do
Please take another chance and let me
Let me have another dance with you
Whenever I feel those pretty arms
Reaching 'round about
That feeling goes to my toes
And all the lights go out, go out, go out
Whenever I see those eyes of blue
Smiling up so shy
I'm in such a spin
I take right off and fly
So let me, oh honey let me
So let me dance in the arms I love
Thrill me through and through
I'm so drunk with love
And all I see is you
I never hear the music play
I never see the crowd
Only you and me
Dancing on a cloud, a cloud, a cloud
If you let the stars keep telling you
Who to love and not to love
You may never find contentment for your heart
You could go unloved forever and darling that means never
Surrender to love, let's forget about the stars
You say that stars have promised you true love ten thousand times
But here you are with a broken heart and mind
I can tell you want to love me from the beating in your heart
Let's forget about the stars, come follow me my dove
To a world just like the world that you've been dreaming of
Let's not wait too long for something might go wrong
Let's forget about the stars
I can see you now living like a queen
In a house that has everything, everything but love
Crystal chandeliers, chauffeured limousines
Yes you'll really have everything, everything but love
I see diamonds and sables, sapphires and pearls
And as the picture clears
Poor little rich girl sitting all alone
Counting her treasures in tears
Better just a shack where two people care
Than a house that has everything, everything but love
I see diamonds, sables, sapphires and pearls
We almost shared a dream
We almost made it as a team
How nice it would have been
We almost touched the stars
And there stood heaven, almost ours
But we were just outsiders looking in
We had the chance to fall
But fate stepped in to end it all
Before it could begin
And if it's true, you're really going
There's nothing but goodbye to say
The saddest part of all is knowing
We almost went all the way
I'm riding the rainbow
Hitting the highway to happiness
Oh yes, I'm looking to find someone
Whose meant to be mine
I'm living to love and loving to live
I've got a heart, I'm longing to give
I'll follow that star to where you are
Heading for heaven and happiness
I guess somebody somewhere
Someday will teach me to care
But being alone
Don't bother me
I'm free to have fun
It's fun to be free
I'll follow that star
To where you are
I want my share of love, it might as well be known
But I ain't thinking of one girl to love alone
That ain't the way it's gonna be, I'm on my own and I am free
And I've been satisfied, so I don't wanna be tied
Somebody's loving arms can sure be sweet I've found
But I want no-one's arms to ever hold me down
Once I get caught inside a net I'm gonna run I bet
I'm gonna run and hide, I don't wanna be tied
I've seen lovers who were matched, they thought that love could stay
Once they cared and got attached, it seems that love just slipped away
Don't want no claims on me
Don't want no chains that bind
As anyone could see
I say what's on my mind
Well there ain't nothing I conceal, I'm gonna play the field
The field of love is wide
I don't wanna be tied
I said I don't, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be tied
Breeze, sing a happy song
This heart of mine is singing right along
Don't know where I'm going, don't know where it ends
Till the grass is greener, beyond the bend
I haven't got a care
I'm just on my way to anywhere
Pocketful of nothing, nothing I can spend
Hope the grass is greener, beyond the bend
Beyond the bend, perhaps there'll be
Somebody waiting who's right for me
So I got to move around
And I know I've got to cover ground
Oh, the trip is shorter when you got a friend
Gotta find that rainbow beyond the bend
I told you that some day
If you kept on being untrue
Somebody else would come along
And release me from you
You'll be glad to know now
Your fickle heart
Can have its own way
For it finally happened
I've met her today
I used to think I just couldn't live
A day without you
In spite of the thousand doubts and tears
That you put me through
All at once I don't care as much for you
I'm sorry to say
For now there's another
I met her today
How I treasured each smile, each kiss
You gave to me now and then
Well, you needn't be kind to me now
Oh no, not ever again
Just when the last bit of pride in me was gone
Someone heard me pray
And sent me my angel
I could wander the byway, rewander too
But it wouldn't be the same without you
Those familiar old places would just make me blue
'Cause it wouldn't be the same without you
I wasted my love on a careless romance
But I'd do it again, if I had the chance
I could start my life over with somebody new
I'm on the right track for lots of kissing
So that old greenback, I won't be missing
All the greatest things in life are free
Who needs money, not me
Cash or credit, it doesn't matter
Long as my bank books keep growing fatter
Easy street is my favorite avenue
Who needs money, I do
Just pity all those millionaires they never can relax
Because they're always worrying about their income tax
Why waste time on high financing, I'd rather spend it on good romancing
What if my pockets are empty as can be
Tell me about it
Some folks save it, some folks lend it
But as for me I want to spend it
Give me some green and my skies will be blue
Stocks and bonds, they only bore me
Interest holds no interest for me
Who wants to sit in the lap of luxury
When I go to bed at night instead of counting sheep
I start counting dollar bills and then I fall asleep
Making money never thrills me
It's making love that really kills me
What can I lose with my philosophy
What do you want
I want a big yacht, I can cruise in
The kind that girls just can't refuse in
All it takes is a million or two
Any time some girl starts flirting
Now that I'm broke I know for certain
She really digs my personality
Tell me, who needs money not me
Poverty's the only thing that money cannot buy
So rich or poor it pays to have M-O-N-E-Y
A gal who's tender, that's what I love
It's legal tender, I want a pile of
Just let my liquid assets overflow
You can't take it with you when you go
So, who needs money
That lovely, lovely money
Ten thousand miles even though I roam
I can hear the call of the hills of home
The canyons high and the valleys low
Echo how can you stay away
My dreams are there where the eagle flies
Where the mountain tops seem to touch the sky
The winding streams and the winds that blow
Ask me how can you stay away
Far too long have I stayed apart
From this land that I love and divide my heart
Now, now I know I must go
Where the hills say don't stay away
I know you're a lonely woman and I love you
But someone else is waiting and he owns you
If he should ever wake up, make sure that your story is straight love
If you talk in your sleep don't mention my name
And if you walk in your sleep forget where you came
Walking every night here in the shadows
So afraid that sometime he may follow
There's always the chance he'll find us
I don't need to remind you
If you walk in your sleep forget where you came
Love is so much sweeter when it's borrowed
I'll feel a little easier tomorrow
Don't give our secret away, be careful what you say
Forget where you came, now
Forget where you came
Don't mention my name
Hail to thee old ivy league
Poison ivy league
The ra-ra boys are sitting round the table tonight
The ra-ra boys have lots of plans in view
They're gonna have panty raids
And make their own lemonade
They'll live it up just like the big boys do
Poison ivy league, boys in that ivy league
Give me an itch, those sons of the rich
That poison ivy league
The ra-ra boys will go to bed so early tonight
Before exams they need a lot of rest
They gotta make good for dad
They gotta make good so bad
They'll even pay someone to take that test
How can they flunk, they're so full of bunk
The ra-ra boys are being groomed for business some day
For better things to college they were sent
And you can bet they'll be the head of the company
As long as dear old daddy's president
So loaded with cash, they give me a rash
So let it be told
I won't touch them with a ten foot pole
That poison Ivy league
Night rider, night rider
You may think that it's the breeze
Whispering through the lonely trees
But it's only him a'flying round the bend
As the day comes to that end
He came riding to town
As the sun was going down
Saw my baby and he smiled her heart away
Now what will I do today
Cautioned my baby to stay at home
Not to leave mama's side
She laughed when I told her take care, take care
Or you'll share in his midnight ride
Since he stole around the side
I ain't had no peace of mind
Night rider, won't you let my baby be
Come on, send her back to me
... mm, stepping through the sinking sand
To the cross of Calvary
Mm, let it be my prayer, dear Lord, each day
To help me do the best I can
For there is no friend on whom I can depend
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand ...
Oh, yes, I need Thee every hour
Through the this pilgrims land
Protect me by thy saving power
Please, hear my feeble plea
Oh, hoh, Lord, please, tell me
I kneel in prayer, I try to meet you there
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand, hold my hand
Like a ship without a compass on a cold lonely sea
No beacon light of love to guide me through
I lost the only treasure that means anything to me
What now, what next, where to?
I thought I had a love that would be mine eternally
I felt so sure you'd be forever true
Now everything I counted on has crumbled under you
You were part of every dream I dreamed, of everything I planned
How could I know our castles were built upon the sand
Won't heaven send an angel please, to tell me what to do
(Danny is my name, oh yes)
My name should be trouble
My name should be woe
For trouble and heartache
Is all that I know
But Danny, yes, Danny is my name
(Whoa yes, whoa yes)
My life has been empty
My heart has been torn
It must have been rainy, oh yes
The night I was born
Oh Danny, oh Danny is my name
I'm so afraid of tomorrow
So tired of today
They say that love is the answer
But love never came my way
I'm writing a letter
To someone I know
So if you should find it, oh yes
And if you're alone
Oh Danny, yes, Danny is my name
(Oh yes)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Well, I'll be back, yeah, I'll be back
Like a homesick train on a one-way track
I got to travel and hit the gravel
But I'll be back, yeah, I'll be back
Well, I'll return, I shall return
Don't cool those lips, we're gonna see them burn
Cause I'll be missing your kind of kissing
Yeah, there ain't nobody to tell me stay or go, oh no
And no one tells the four winds where to blow
I'll be back, I'm coming back
Don't throw away that welcome mat
The door I'm hoping, will still be open a teeny weenie crack
To your shack
So keep that love light burnin'
The door I'm hoping will still be open a teeny weenie crack
So keep that love light burnin', I'll be back
Yeah, I'll be back
Some kids born with a silver spoon
I guess that I was born a little too soon
Hard knocks, all I ever knew was hard knocks
And I'm telling you, I said you'd better beware
Cause I've had my share
Some kids born as rich as a king
But I was born without a doggone thing
I walked a million miles I bet
Tired and hungry and cold and wet
I've heard that lonesome whistle blow
From New York City down to Mexico
Some kids born fancy free
Nobody never gave nothing to me but
I said you'd better beware
Cause I've had my share of hard knocks
Hey little girl, you sure are cute to me
Come up a little closer, so I can see
Hold it baby now stay right where you are
Hey little girl you oughta be a movie star
Hey little girl, come on and dance with me
You're about the cutest thing I ever did see
Hey little girl, I'd like to take you home
Come on, come on, come on I want you for my very own
All right hoo! hoo!
Hey little girl, you better hang on tight
A-won't you swing it to the left, and shake it to the right
Hey little girl, you know you're looking fine
Get ready honey let's go just-a one more time
When her motor's warm, and she's purring sweet
Buddy let me warn you, you're on a one-way street
She'll crowd you close, spin your wheels
Then you're gonna know how it feels
To spinout, yeah, spinout
Better watch those curves, never let her steer
If she can shake your nerves, boy
Then she can strip your gears
She'll get you high and going fast
Then she'll let you run out of gas
So spinout, yeah, spinout
The road to love is full of danger signs
Too many guys were lost who crossed those double lines
Don't you know she's out to prove she can really score
Never saw parts move, boy
Like that before
To flag you down, that's her goal
Scoot before you lose control
And spinout, yeah, spinout
And spinout, spinout, spinout, all right
Finders, keepers, losers, weepers
I won't weep and I won't moan
Because I found you and your love so true
And I'm keeping you for my own
Heads I win or tails I lose
I bet my heart to win your love
The day you kissed me, good luck was with me
And I thank my lucky stars above
I'm not the kind to play for fun
I only play for keeps and I'm keeping all the love I won
The loser has to pay the score
He lost you and I found you
And I'm keeping you for ever more
Yeah he lost you and I found you
Michigan State, MIT
Harvard University

Well I want my breakfast 'cause I'm a hungry man
I believe you're doin' me wrong and now I know
'cause the harder I work the faster my money goes
Well you won't do right
To save your doggone soul
I'm like the one-eyed cat peeping in a seafood store
Well I can look at you till you ain't no child no more
I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin' on a hollow stump
I won't ever leave ...
Don't ever say goodbye
Western Union
Oh, Western Union clickety clack
I had a fight with my baby
Ooh how sorry I am
She won't talk to me no how
I'm gonna send a telegram
Western Union oh yeah
Send my loving baby back to me
She won't open my letters
She won't answer the phone
When I'm a-ringing her doorbell
She says there ain't nobody home
I love you is my message
Just three words and no more
If she won't let you deliver
Slip it underneath her door
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
Take my hand
Take my whole life too
Take my whole life, too
You kiss me darling, a miracle starts
A magic feeling, comes into our hearts
The spell of love began, when we're alone
And we're in, a world of our own
You say you want me, and music I hear
Touch me my darling, and clouds disappear
The sky is bright above, and cares have flown
Holding you close, is heaven
Only I know, what it's worth
Knowing you're mine, forever
Is the greatest wonder on earth
Nothing can change it, the magic's begun
When we're together, our hearts become one
I find a happiness, I've never known
When we're in, a world of our own
When we're in...a world of our own
Your time hasn't come yet, baby
You got a lot of dreams to go
But when it does your heart will know
You're gonna be a beautiful woman
Because you're such a beautiful child
And when you start to bloom
Just like a rose in June
I bet the schoolboys all go wild, but right now
Your life's still a lollipop heaven
With teddy bears at the foot of your bed
The little boy next door who only makes you sore
Is gonna some day turn your head but right now
You're going to grow over night into a lady
With a devastatingly smile
And then a lucky guy will see you
And want to walks you down the aisle, but meanwhile
You got a few dreams to go
When it does your heart will know
Woke up early in the morning
What did the poor boy find?
Well, the car was gone and you were gone
And I almost lost my mind
If you don't come back
(If you don't come back)
Yeah, if you don't come back today
(If you don't come back today)
You can call up the people at the crazy house
And take this crazy man away
Threw himself up against a stone wall
He tore his clothes at us all
Well, I ran out on the street in my stockinged feet
Tell the police I've been robbed
Mrs. Brown's been talking about me
To the people across the street
She said, "I cooked that boy a bucket of stew
But the poor thing just won't eat"
Step right up to the love machine
You may get lucky when you zap a dream
Let the wheel go round, round and round
You may win that girl you've never found
She may be Suzy or Maybelline
She could be Cathy or Angeline
Try your luck right now on the love machine
We're just a bunch of salty sailors
One thing on our mind
Taking a chance on this machine
Maybe love we'll find
She maybe tall she maybe short
She may be wide
But Lady Luck stop that wheel
On 38-24-35
Step up, whose next in line
This love machine don't waste no time
What will your fortune be on the love machine
Let the wheel go round and round and round
And round and round and round and round
This is a wonderful day
It's as bright as a day's ever been
There is a big yellow sun looking down
On a wonderful scene
Up in the blue sky birds fly
And sing our cares away
And out of each throat each note
Greets a wonderful day
There is the sound of a symphony
Carried along on the breeze
Even the flowers are swaying in time
With the leaves on the trees
Heaven is found right here on the earth
It surrounds us in the wonderful things all around
In this wonderful wonderful
Wonderful wonderful world
Wonderful world, this wonderful world
Listen, to the wisdom of the ages
Listen, to the words of many sages
Live each day, as if it were your last
It's written in the stars, your destiny is cast
And that hourglass, runs too fast no doubt
For the sands of time are running out
These words, can be found in history's pages
Live each day, for happiness can't wait
And love while you may, but heed the hand of fate
If the finger points, it's too late no doubt
For the sands of time, are running out
But the man who turns, and escapes somehow
Is the wisest of men
And to such a man, I'd bow
Rain was your birth
Gathered deep
Beneath the earth
Search and seep
Hollow stone
Issue and flow
Virgin stream
Meander free
It's a long way to the sea
Caves and canyons
Stark prison walls
Swirl and hurl you
Could I fall in love for the very first time
That's what I ask myself when you're lips touch mine
Could I fall in love on a night like tonight
That's what I'd like to know when I hold you tight
Now that we're alone (Now that we're alone)
Just a kiss apart (Just a kiss apart)
I have the answer from the feeling in my heart
Could I fall in love and forever be true
My heart tells me I could if I fell for you
This was gonna be the night tonight
I was gonna get to hold you tight
But I guess we didn't plan it right
I never stood a chance, we couldn't dance
Cause there's , no room to rhumba in a sports car
You can't move forward or back
There's no room to do what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine outta wack
When a little kiss I want to steal
I hit my head against the steering wheel
Now I know the way a pretzel feels
All I can do is shout. Hey let me out!!
What a way to waste a day with you
Nothing happens that can tell the truth
Let's go out and find a telephone booth
Yeah that's a better place, I like more space
Just for old time sake
Won't you give my heart a break
Let's get together again
Let's relive the time
I was yours and you were mine
Life was so wonderful then
I know, now I know the day I let you go
I made my greatest mistake
If you loved me then
You could love me once again
Won't you try just for old time sake
Viva el vino, viva el dinero
Viva, Viva
El amor
I like to drink wine, and money is fine
But I like the girls even more
Viva el vino, viva el dinero, viva viva el amor
Some pesos you pass, put wine in her glass
And soon she will say "si senor"
With wine on your lips and money in your pocket
And your sweetheart in your arms
You're rich as you can be
So lift up your glass, let's sing it all together
Muchachas, caballeros, make this toast with me
We'll drink one more time, with money and wine
Let's drink to the girls we adore
Sing one more time, money and wine
Let's sing to the girls we adore
Viva el vino, viva el dinero, viva viva
Sweet Angeline I loved you much more than poets say in rhyme
Just for one short time
Sweet Angeline remember though we've not seen the summer through
I lived only for you
I'm only human and I realize it's no use trying to disguise
My love for you Angeline has ended
So let's be thankful now not sad
For the little love we've had
I'm just a roustabout
Shifting from town to town
No job can hold me down, I'm just a knock-around guy
There's a lot of space beneath that sky
Till I find my place there's no doubt
I'll be a roving' roustabout
Call me the carefree kind
I wander with the breeze
My mind and heart's at ease
Doing what pleases me best
Gotta keep-a movin' east or west
And even if a pretty girl, should catch my eye
I'll give her a quick "hello", and a fast goodbye
I'll go the way I want
Drifting' just like the sand
Doing' what job I can
Changing my plans as I choose
Long as I keep happy I can't lose
I'll be a roving' roustabout,  I'll be a roving' roustabout
I'll be a roving' roustabout, Rovin', Rovin' roustabout
There are lots of girls in the mountains
And they're worth their weight in gold
When they're in my arms with their loving charms
A treasure chest I hold
Well there's gold in the mountains, love in the hills
I don't need no city women with their diamonds and frills
There's gold in the mountains and oh what scenery
The prettiest girls I ever did see
There's such beauty there in the mountains
You can feel your knees growing weak
Every single boy feels the height of joy
When he climbs that mountain peak
I said there's gold in the mountains, love in the hills
I ever did see
All you got is one life
Living once can be rough
But if you live every day all the way
Once is enough
You can own just one suit
Worn and torn at the cuff
But if you're living the life that you love
What's the good of reaching ninety
If you waste eighty-nine
You got one life so live it
If you don't it's a crime
Life's a playful puppy
You can grab by the scruff
And if you live every second what the heck
Never wait until tomorrow
What if it never comes
Life is a seven layer
Don't you settle for crumbs
Before you go, walk out on me
Take a look around, tell me what you see
Here I stand like an open book
Is there something here, you might have overlooked
'Cause it would be a shame if you should leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be
The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad
Now you say that you've grown tired
You want to be by yourself awhile
It would be a shame if you should go
And find that freedom was a long time ago
I know that you can't stand the chains that bind you
They just keep on drivin' us apart
And you could go where I could never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart
So one more time, for ol' times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest
Please don't throw this moment away
We can forget the bad and take the best
If you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake
And if you don't have nothing left to say
Do the Vega take a chance and do the Vega
If you dance it you'll have fun
The fever gets you and then I'll bet you
You'll shake like a sun of a gun
First you make the right connection
Choose the one who's your selection
Though you risk your reputation
You'll increase your circulation
Roll and keep your shoulders busy
Like a wheel spin 'till you're dizzy
Kick your heels when you've a notion
Shake and shimmy that's the motion
You'll shake like the sun of a gun
Shake like the sun of a gun
Did you ever notice when the sun goes down
Out of nowhere comes a strange and pretty sound
It's a whistling tune for walking in the night
If you listen you can hear it in the breeze
Specially when the breeze is drifting through the trees
And the murmuring waters sing the song
The echoing mountains hum along
The whispering valleys fill the air
With a whistling tune our hearts can share
It's so wonderful to walk beneath the moon
Listening to old mother nature's favorite tune
Cowboy, cowboy marry me
I'll bake you a cherry pie
Well thank you very kindly mam
But I'm too young to die
Hi-lo-do-si-dosy-do
Stay single and save a dollar
Come Saturday night I'll court a pretty girl
With a cane and a high starched collar
Cowboy if you'll marry me
I'll be your darling Jenny
Now why should I drink from just one well
When I can drink from twen'y
Cowboy, cowboy name the day
July 'd be nice I reckon
Gladly meet you at the church
July the 32nd
You sleep all day and spoon all night
And eat your favorite chow
Then why should I get married mam
That's what I'm doing now
Oh, how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me
When I am discouraged
And I feel the gloom
God sends His angel
To see Him my broom
IU hear the singing
I'm satisfied
I know, I know
That Jesus is mine
Oh, how I love Jesus (He is so wonderful)
To know that Jesus is mine
Tony is a Capricorn, a leader of men
And he has a kinda stubborn streak
But when it comes to the opposite sex
Tony's kinda shy and weak
Oh, but he can be hot stuff
See the look on his face
If you want a wedding
It's him you've gotta chase
Uh, uh, uh
Signs of the zodiac, signs of the zodiac
The future is in those little signs of the zodiac
Michael is a Scorpio; he can't make up his mind
Poor boy he can't decide at all
He wants one girl and then another
Soon there'll be none left but mother
Oh, but, Michael, that won't do
That just won't do at all
You can't marry your mother
Your mother's much too tall, ha ha, ho ho
Billy is a Libra, a sign of love
Billy has a one-track mind
He's great in the kitchen and never complains
He's the happily married kind
Help is there in your future if you just look around
You don't know your astrology from a hole in the ground
The first time I saw you I knew I was hooked on somebody other than me
The first time I held you, your soft lips and blue eyes
Were as far as my eyes could see
Yes here in my arms I knew I had found the reason that I'm living for
And I felt the feeling, such a wonderful feeling
That I'd never felt before
Baby, your love's been a long time coming
Baby your love's got a hold on me
Baby your love's sure got me humming
Baby your love's been a long time coming
Deep in my heart there's a feeling I never knew
Until I saw a love that was very new
I'm going to tell everyone what good love can do
---
This is living
Full of fun and free
That's the life for me
It's good to laugh and sing
Don't worry about a thing
Wear a happy smile
Cut loose and run a mile
If you relax and just enjoy it all
Life has got to be a ball
It wouldn't mean a thing
If I could be a king
I really wouldn't care
To be a millionaire
I'd rather find someone to love a lot
Live and give it all I've got
Don't want to settle down
I got to move around
I got to lot of time
I'm going to wait and find
The kind of girl who's heart is restless too
The kind who feels the way I do
Am I ready, can my heart be true?
Am I ready, to fall in love with you
One love, one girl, one dream shared by two
I have touched your lips, and now I know
I would be a fool, to let you go
Should I, could I, how I wish I knew
Fall in love with you
I was dancin' with my darlin' to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced her to my loved one
And while they were dancin'
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz
Some guys fall in love with one girl, I got to fall for two
There's just so much loving that one heart's supposed to do
So I go around with my heart dragging on the ground
Dogging me around, I'm the sorriest sight in town
I got double trouble, I got double trouble
I got double trouble twice as much as anybody else, oh yeah
I guess there's got to be two dark clouds hanging over me
My future looks a bumpy as a matchbox on the sea
Every time I think that I have finally got it made
Some losing cards are played, I just can't make the grade
Hands off of her, she belongs to me
Mojo working don't belong to you
Well, she's mine all mine no matter what you do
Play it boys, play it boys
I got my mojo working but it just don't work on you
But you're mine all mine no matter what you do
Let me tell you now
She's long lean and lanky, sweet as she can be
Hands off of her' don't belong to you
Well she's mine all mine no matter what you do
Well you're mine all mine no matter what you do
Play it Jerry, play it
No matter what you do, play it son
Well she's long lean and lanky, sweet as she can be
Hands off of her unless you want to deal with me
I got my mojo working I got my mojo working
Well, you're mine all mine no matter what you do
One more time!
Listen to me now
I said you're long lean and lanky cute as you can be
Get your hands off of her, she doesn't belong to you
Yeah, I got my mojo working I got my mojo working
Oh yes, I know it's true
The more you fall in love
The more your heart can break in two
Now that you've said goodbye
For every tender kiss
I've had the tears I cry
I gave my heart and soul
All the love I knew
Oh how much it hurts me now
To know that we are through
I'll always feel this way
My arms will be so empty
You'll return some day and say
Your love, yes your big love
Will be here to stay
Till then it's
Big Love, Big Heartache
Your love yes your big love
There were five sleepyheads
All tucked into their beds
While I sang a lullaby
One got dream dust in her eye
There were four sleepyheads
Playing possum with me
Mr. Sandman came by
And then there were three
Moonbeams play peek-a-boo
Three away became two
And my song was almost done
When the land of Nod took one
Kissed the last one good night
Then I heard not a peep
Now they're all fast asleep
Pedro the bull was a killer
King of the bullfighter ringer
He'd wipe up the floor with each brave matador
And have matador stew for his dinner
He heard the crowd shouting "Ole"
But he met his master that day
The bullfighter was a lady
And it was true love at first sight
Her red cape was waving but Pedro was shaking
He wanted to date her that night
Ole!
Pedro the bull he was smitten
First time the love bug had bitten
He once was a mad bull, a wild and a bad bull
But now he was mild as a kitten
The people were starting to hiss
But Pedro just wanted to kiss
And Pedro he liked what he saw
He floated on air with a rose in his hair
As he waltzed with that sweet matador
His fate was a bad one, his tale is a sad one
It's hanging right over her door
We had a real good evening
Now all our friends are leaving
Soon we'll be alone
Wait till everybody has gone
Then play just one more song
Because this is our dance
Darling, remember, it's our dance
Loving and tender
I'll take you away, take you away
Yes, this is our dance, now we're together
For our dance can't last forever
And nobody knows just what tomorrow will bring
So let our dance begin
We'll turn the light down low now
I'll never let you go now
You're here in my arms
And when I hear you whisper you're mine
We'll play that song just one more time
Some folks tell you what to do
They think they know more than you
They insist that they're giving sound advice
But as sure as you're living
It ain't sound, it ain't nice
It just doesn't sound like sound advice
Some folks like to be the boss
They get up on their high horse
Oh they say that you're getting, sound advice
There's one thing I'm betting
It ain't wise, it ain't nice
You won't like the sound of their advice
Sound advice we're given
Sound advice
Just as sure as your as you're living
If your smart you'll think twice
When they start to sound off with advice
Don't listen to their sound advice
I'm just a Smokey mountain boy
Come back to the hills I love
Where the tops of pine all bend in the wind
And the deep blue sky above
The closer and closer I get to home
The more excited I am
Those were the mornings I'd roll out of bed
Start the day off with a hot corn bread
Smothered in huckleberry jam
I can almost hear the hounds running through the woods
Close on the trail of the hare
How I long to be with them following the hounds a-hunting again
Getting me a big old grizzly bear
I traveled around and met lots of girls
No matter how many I see
I left some pretty ones behind
I know back home is where I'll find
The girl whose love means for me
The wonderful world of Christmas
Is a wonderful world to behold
Was made for the young and the old
Smile and good cheer of each neighbor
And children with cheeks all aglow
So, warm is this Christmassy feeling
With the tree tops all locked up with snow
Listen to those wondrous bells
And you'll hear them say
Open up your hearts to all on this holiday
Is a joy from the moment it starts
Shall remain every day in our hearts
(Open up your hearts to all, to the wonderful world of Christmas)
Happy ending, happy ending
Give me a story with a happy ending
When boy meets girl and then they never part again
But live forever happily like you and me
Hard luck stories get me so upset
Like Romeo and Juliet
I'm not smart enough to figure why
Some folks enjoy a real good cry
(You and me, you and me, you and me, you and me)
Never thought that I would stand a chance
That you'd give me a second glance
But I think that you can play the part
And give a guy a happy heart
(You and me)
Like you and me, like you and me
(You and me, you and me, like you and me)
The girl I never loved
Will never know I cared
And all my dreams of her
Are dreams I'll never share
For I want her and I need her
And I know it might have been
But it ended long before it could begin
The kiss I never got
Somebody else will take
The plans I never made
Somebody else will make
Oh I'm lonely, I'm so lonely
Because it's her I'm thinking of
But she'll always be the girl I never loved
Never loved, never loved
When you say that's it boy
I'm finally beat
You're going ninety miles an hour
Down a dead end street
You don't want to fight no more
You think that you can't win
Come on boy take a real deep breath
Jump right in and
Hold your head up high
Oh you got to be strong
Come on and sing, sing, sing
There is nothing like a song
Now they may take away your job
Take your fancy car
They may repossess your clothes, take that fine guitar
They may take everything you own
Well that's just for today
As long as you've got a song in your heart
Tomorrow's gonna be O.K
There is nothing going to stop you
Once you've set your mind
The only people going to knock you
Are jealous of what they find
Just keep a smile right on your face
Don't let them get you down
When you wake up tomorrow
The world is spinning round
Hold your head up high, hey, hey, hey
You gotta be strong, all right
There ain't nothing like a song
[Elvis 
Nancy Sinatra
Well lovin's all that I can give you
(
Baby that's enough
)
You ain't easy to satisfy
Baby I ain't that tough
Now hey little girl you're about the wildest
Thing I've ever seen
When I'm with you baby I'm a lovin' machine
Come on and kiss me honey
Oh you gotta be strong
Come on and sing, sing
Come on and sing, (
sing
) sing
) sing, (
One good turn deserves another
Be my love, I'll be your lover
It's all part of nature's laws
If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch yours
If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch your back
Like two peas in a pack, let's get rid of our itch together, Hmm
Joy they say is in the giving
Come on give, make life worth living
Your welfare is my concern
Do a favor for me, I'll do one in return
Scratch me now a little lower
What a feeling, do it slower
That's it, Hmm you're getting hot
Well I got to admit, you just hit the spot
Oh, I'm really feeling mighty low
No, no, no, I got no place that I can go
So I've got some blues to sing
And oh, so much remembering, woe
Black cats, keep away from me
Take my advice, go shinning up a tree
I got hard luck, the hardest kind a luck you'll find
I ain't lyin', I've got the bluest kinda blues
Driving' me right outta my mind
She's gone, said toodle-loo
Kissed her goodbye and my, my, my money too
I've got hard luck, the hardest kinda luck you've seen
I mean, the way I'm running' lately
My lucky number is thirteen
Where do I belong, everything I do is wrong
All wrong, wrong as can be
Who's stacking all the decks
Lady luck has got the hex on me
I'm on her knee da da da da
Shove off, oh, I'm warning you
This thing I caught, you know could be catching too
I've got hard luck, the hardest kinda luck there can be
Yes, sir, I guess hard luck always chooses
Natural born losers like me, oh ah
Going to travel, going to travel wild and free
I'm going to pack my bags because this great big world is calling me
Every pretty girl's going to know I'm around
They're going to know I'm in town on a harem holiday
Twenty women, twenty women by my side
I'm going to kiss them all, because I've got to keep them satisfied
Going to have the best time money can buy
I'm going to be flying high on a harem holiday
If Romeo had a harem holiday
You can bet that Juliet would have never been his girl forever
Going to go back, going to catch that midnight plane
Twenty dancing girls are waiting just to call my name
Catch that midnight plane
Going to have a ball, I am not going to waste no time
I'm going to make them all mine on a harem holiday
How can you lose what you never had
I tell myself when I'm feeling sad
You don't have the right to cry
You believed your own lie
It's your fault because
You thought that she was yours
Think it over once, think it over twice
I wish I could take my own advice
I know I should be glad, why does it hurt so bad
Take a ton of bolt and steel
A whole lot to sweat, a set of wheels
On the Speedway
The flag is down, pistons pound
Plenty of engines ripping around
Go for the money and lead the pack
Push the throttle and burn the track
Curl and swirl like you doing a dance
Straightaway is coming and now's your chance
On the Speedway, on the Speedway, on the Speedway
Stomp that pedal down to the floor
As much as you give, crowd wants more
More, more, more, more, more on the Speedway
Take a spin, hit the brakes
A young little girl shivers and shakes
Clear the way, coming through
Kiss from your baby is just pushing you
On the Speedway, on the Speedway
All en el rancho grande
All donde vva
Habl una rancherita
Que alegre me deca
Que alegre me deca:
"Te voy hacer unas calzones
Comos los que esa el ranchero
Los comenzo de lana
Y los acabo de hierro."
There in the great ranch
There where she used to live
There used to be a cowgirl
Who joyfully used to tell me
"I'm going to make some trousers
Like those which the cowboy wears
I'm starting them with wool
And I'm finishing them with iron."
Thanks to the rolling, rolling, rolling, thanks to the rolling sea
Fish on the table and fish on the fire, fried fish hanging on the tree
Everything here that your heart desires, thanks to the rolling sea
Thanks to the rolling sea
Living is good, and living is fine, we're happy as can be
We owe all this to the salty brine, thanks to the rolling sea
We work all day, but our hearts are gay, and while we work we sing
The mighty sea is good to us, and we've got everything
Abalone steaks and tuna fish cakes, taste so heavenly
We know who we owe it to, thanks to the rolling sea
Hey everybody gather round
And listen to that bongo sound
Grab the first one in your reach
Now we're going to shake the beach
Do the Clam, do the Clam
Grab your barefoot baby by the hand
Turn and tease, hug and squeeze
Dig right in and do the Clam
You can get your heart to spin
On the outside looking in
The moon ain't going to last all night
Let's work up an appetite
Everybody's got that beat
Well, listen to those happy feet
Ain't you glad that you found out
What the Clam is all about
Oh and grab your barefoot baby by the hand
I've gotta gal, oh what a pal
The apple of my eye
With something rare, a peach of a pear
But her dad won't let us meet
and I could die
[Verse 2: Elvis Presley & 
Donna Douglas
I love Petunia, the gardener's daughter
Oh, how that gal can kiss
Her eyes are blue as bluebells
Each cheek a rose to see
How I dance when she plants her two lips on me
I'm as daffy as a daffodil
I long to kiss her all the time
Tonight I'll steal into her garden
And make Petunia's two lips mine
[Verse 3: Elvis Presley & 
I've got a beau
, I love him so
But my dad won't let us meet and I could die
And we could die
My eyes are blue as bluebells
[Verse 5: Elvis Presley & 
He's as daffy as a daffodil
He loves to kiss me all the time
[Verse 6: Elvis Presley & 
She makes other girls look just like weeds
I'm gonna be his clinging vine
And make Petunia's two lips
My ever loving two lips
Make Petunia's two lips mine
I didn't make it on playing guitar
Ha ha ha ha ha...
The day you said we'd never part
You turned around and broke my heart
You had the nerve to tell me I would soon forget
Now you've been gone away one year
And I have not forgotten, dear
The love I had for you so long
Is still here
Wow-oh
It's here, still here
Because my heart cannot believe
We're really through
And though you said we'd never part
At night
When the sky is still
When the south wind blows
And the air is warm
There's a world that's born
And for every child on the beach that day
Stands a castle tall and proud
And the warm wind crawls through the castle walls
And the night folk wakes as the warm wind calls
Then the fiddler crab plays his violin
On the back of a dancing whale
While the mermaids sing to the shell they bring
And the dragon leads with his sweeping tail
For the rosy dawn
Brings the children on to a beach that's bright and new
And the night folk know as the castles grow
They will play once more as the children do
What's in the drink, chase the Devil away
Magic I think so I just say Chesay
Chesay, Chesay bring you good luck night and day
Chesay, Chesay that's the gypsy way
Trouble is my middle name
Though it's such a crying shame
Try and try there's nothing I can do
But I'm feeling kinda strange
Feel like things are going to change
Time my lucky star was shining through
Drink a cup of gypsy love
Just tip it up and then you just say Chesay
Swallow once then swallow twice
Goes down so nice just say Chesay, hey
Chesay, Chesay brings you good luck night and day
Chesay
What he's done for others, he'll do for you
With arms wide open, he'll pardon you
There is no night for in his light
You never walk alone
Take him at his promise
Mine is a heart
That beats for only you
Mine is a love that always will be true
For ever more, beyond the end of time
I will be your love, promise you'll be mine
Easy come, easy go
Here, there, everywhere
Crazy love is in the air
Nightfall, mm, day and nightfall
So many girls in every port
You got to be a juggernaut
Full speed ahead or you'll be caught
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Up, down, all around, kiss and kiss
And pound for pound, delicious
Mm, so nutritious
Sailor beware take it slow
Easy come, easy go, all right
When you want love to keep you warm
There's nothing like a uniform
You got a port in any storm
There she blows
Look out now, I'm running wild
There ain't no holding back this child
I guess you'd say I'm a son of a gun
Living just for a life of fun
Here's the secret of my success
Never say yes, no, no, never say yes
Life has taught me one big lesson
Always keep the girl's guessing
Tell them that you love them so
You hate to leave but you got to go
It's the oldest game in the world
And you got to know how to play it
Tell her yes in so many ways
But never ever say it
And that's how I keep going on
Here today, tomorrow gone
That's the kind of life for me
Being free like I want to be
Now that's how I keep going on
And that's the kind of life for me
No, no, never say yes
If I knew the way I'd go back home
The countryside has changed so much I'd surely end up lost
Half-remembered names and faces so far in the past
On the other side of the bridges that were burned once they were crossed
Tell me where, where does a fool go when there's no-one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go when he knows there's something missing
Tell me where, where will I go from here
Where will I go from here
Get back home where my childhood dreams and wishes still are none of my regrets
Go back to a place where I can figure all the odds
Have a fighting chance to lose the blues and win my share of bets
O beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above thy fruited plain
America, America
God shed His grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea
For beautiful..for spacious skies
For purple mountain..majesties
Above the fruited plain...
America!...America!...
God shed His grace..on thee..
And crowned thy good, with brotherhood
From sea...to shining sea...
America!..America!!
God shed his grace on thee
From sea...to..shining..sea!!
AMERICA!!!....
Won't you show me how to kiss
Put your lips on mine
Do you do it just like this
Tell me I'm doing fine
We got a good thing going now take your time
Come on and make it last
Love may be new to you but ooh, I'm catching on fast
Give, give, give me all you've got to give
Love, love, love every moment you live
Now you've taught me all you know
Have I passed the test
Show me all you've got to show
Baby you're the best
But tell me I've learned quickly and I know each trick
I'm sure love's going to last
Love maybe new to you but Oooh I'm catching on fast
Ev'rybody's got the fever
He said 'Julie, baby, you're my flame
Thou giv-est fever when we kisseth
Fever I'm afire
Fever yea I burn forsooth
Gotta do some living, got the wanderlust
Better clear the highway cause I'm gonna move some dust
Oh I got wheels, wheels on my heels
And I gotta keep rolling, rolling along
Lots of pretty dollies try to fence me in
But I love and leave them cause a tumbleweed's my kin
Why do I keep moving', never settling' down
Can it be I'm looking for a dream I haven't found
And I gotta keep Rolling, rolling along
Ooh yes we're coming in loaded, Ooh yes we're coming in loaded
I'll hold the boat steady brother like a rock
Full speed ahead until we hit the dock
We're heading for home, the fishing was great
We're comin' in loaded 'cause we're all out of bait
Well, well, well, well, well
Oh well now yeah!
We got 'em packed to the water-line
Some got away but the catch was fine
Never saw such big ones, man oh man
We're comin' in loaded just as fast as we can
I'm gonna see my baby soon as I get back
Knock on the door with my pockets packed
She'll look at me well she can't say no
We're comin' in loaded so come on let's go
Yeah! we're coming in loaded
You ask how much I need you
Must I explain
I need you oh my darling
Like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I'll tell you true
Until the twelfth of never I'll still be loving you
Hold me close
Melt my heart like April snow
I'll love you 'till the blue bells forget to bloom
I'll love you 'till the clover has lost its perfume
I'll love you 'till the poets run out of rhyme
Oh, until the twelfth of never
And that's a long long time
Until the twelfth of never
Take me to the fair
Take me to the fair, don't know anywhere
I would rather be
Let's, go to the fair
We'll walk hand in hand, through Tomorrow Land
Honey you and me
I wanna see everything, do everything
While we're doin' it all
I'll buy the peanuts and popcorn
We'll have us a ball
You can spend my pay
Crush me in the crowds, I'll be in the clouds
Honey I don't care
Take me there by sleigh
Roller skate or bike, anyway you like
But take me to the fair
When you meet by chance, it's not by chance
It's kismet
When two hearts stand still, it's destiny's will
The wheel of fortune spins, round and around it goes
Who will the arrow point to, only kismet knows
Until you came by, kismet and I were strangers
But now that you're here, it's suddenly clear we've met
This is my lucky day, love's in the cards I'd say
Thanks to kismet, kismet, kismet
Listen, little lady
You're steppin' out of line
What's your hurry baby
You got a lot of time
That's not love you feel
It's only make believe
Watch out, you'll break the heart
You're wearing on you sleeve
Cheating with your kisses
You think you know it all
Old worry gonna get you
You're riding for a fall
Better slow it down
I see a danger sign
Cause the way you're steppin' around
How would you like to be?
A little circus clown
And you could wear a smile
Instead of a frown
A little kangaroo
A-hoppin' up and down
And I could hop with you
Come on and smile a little, smile a little
Hop a little, hop a little
Smile a little, hop a little bit with me
A little buzzing bee
And instead of a tree
You could buzz around me
A little mocking bird
And you can sing me songs
Like I never heard
A little baby bear
And you can hug me tight
Any time you care
A little dancing doll
And you could dance with me
Everytime I call
When shadows beckon on dim-lit avenues
Night people hear the call
From hidden alleys, and secret rendezvous
They come out one and all
The city by night eyes wide awake
It never sleeps make no mistake
Whatever sets off the spark
A magic glow lights the dark
Then I'm intrigued by the sight
Of the city by night
Those crowded nightclubs
Those picturesque cafes
Are scenes no-one forgets
And I'm enchanted, music softly plays
By dancing silhouettes
The evening's full of surprise
It's magic opens my eyes
And I'm intrigued by the sight
Come along, come along, there's a full moon shining bright
Come along, come along, 
we're gonna hit St. Louis tonight
Spend your money
looking at the chorus line
Spend your money, win it on the number 9
Take your sweetheart even though she's never been
If she's worried tell her that you always win
Come along, come along, you're gonna win a fortune tonight
Hear the whistle, lady luck's about to go
Is she smiling, maybe yes or maybe no
Now's the time when nights are filled with sweet romance
Don't be bashful step on up and take a chance
Come along, come along, we're gonna hit St. Louis tonight
Come along, come along, we're gonna win a fortune tonight
Baby you've been lying to me now I'm onto you
It's the same old song but it doesn't ring true
That's right you're wrong again
Time to change and put you on your own again
You've had your way too long
Time for me to be moving on
You gotta stop, you're wrong again
Stop  that song again
You've been stepping' out wild and fancy free
Now you've had your fun and you're running back to me
It just can't be if there's no harmony
Then stop!
That's all let's break it up
You've had me fooled now I'm working' up
I see right through your lies
You made me open my eyes
It's too late now I've made up my mind
Being here with you is just a waste of time
Nothing to say so I'll be on my way
Stop!
Then stop! Stop! You're wrong again
Stop that song again
Stop! You're wrong again
You gotta stop that song again
Softly and tenderly jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
Patient and loving he's waiting and watching;
Watching for you and for me
Come home, come home
Ye who are weary come home;
Earnestly, tenderly, jesus is calling;
Calling, "o sinner, come home!"
Why should we linger when jesus is pleading
Pleading for you and for me?
Why should we wait, then, and heed not his mercies;
Mercies for you and for me?
O for the wonderful love he has promised
Promised for you and for me
Though we have sinned he has mercy and pardon;
Pardon for you and for me
You can't say no, in Acapulco
With every beat your heart will answer yes
Where lovers sing instead of talk
And dance instead of walk together
In a night, that's filled with stars
And strumming guitars
Where romance blooms, and love is in the air
So kiss me tender, love me true
Darling feel this magic too
Don't say no, you can't say no, in Acapulco
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
Yes and how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes and how many times must cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
How many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
How many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
How many years can a mountain exist
Before it's washed to the seas (sea)
How many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
How many times can a man turn his head
Pretend that he just doesn't see?
Dominic, Dominic why are you stallin'
Don't you hear love callin' to you
Moo, moo, move your little foot do
Dominic, Dominic pick one of them ticker
There's acres and acres to choose
Oh, oh, only a fool would refuse
I, I, If I had your trouble
Life would be double good sweet
There'd be no grass growin' under my feet
Listen Dominic, Dominic when will you hunger
You ain't gettin' younger my friend
Love, love, love 'em all right to the end
I, I, I can't understand you, leavin' them beauties forlorn
It's time to take the old bull by the horn
Come on Dominic, Dominic, they're itchin' and twitchin'
Better start pickin' some woo
Moo, moo, move your little foot do!
When I was a little baby
My mother would rock me in the cradle
In them old, old cotton fields at home
Oh, when them cotton balls get rotten
You couldn't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields at home
It was down in Louisiana
Just a mile from Texarkana
It may sound a little funny
But, you didn't make very much money
I was over in Arkansas
People ask me, "What you come here for?"
Oh, when those cotton balls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
She'll tell you that she loves you, make you feel just like a king
She'll cry to you and lie to you, she'll do almost anything
She'll get right up next to you and the first thing that you know
You'll be telling her you're sorry because she hurt you so
I said she's evil the most evil girl I've found
There ain't no doubt about it, she's the meanest girl in town
She'll invite you over to her house at half past nine
You'll wear a suit, you'll wear a tie and you'll give your shoes a shine
You'll take a real deep breath and knock on her front door
Her little sister will tell you "She don't live here anymore"
There is no doubt about it, she's the meanest girl in town
And there is no doubt about it, she's the meanest girl in town
She'll put her arms around you and squeeze with all her might
She'll breathe a sigh and pucker her lips and close her eyes real tight
Your heart will pound like thunder, you'll melt in her embrace
But when you go to kiss her well she'll laugh right in your face
Because she's evil the most evil girl I've found
When you're through swimming
I'll dry your back
Come and relax, girl
In my little beach shack
You believe me now
Dum-di-dum-di-dum, yeah-yeah-yeah
There'll be nothing you'll lack
It's a pleasure to welcome you
To my little beach shack
In my beach shack, baby, we'll be alone
In my beach shack, I'll make you feel at home
Take off that wet cap
Let down your hair
Come to my beach shack
You'll be comfortable there
Be my guest, have a snack
See how nice I treat company
Come see my etchings
I wish you would
Don't be afraid, girl
My intentions are good
I know girls by the pack
There's no one I want there but you
Well I can see that you and yoga will never do
Yoga is as yoga does there's no in-between
Your either with it on the ball or you've blown the scene
I can see looking at you, you just can't get settled
How can I even move, twisting like a pretzel
Come on come on, untwist my legs
Pull my arms a lot
How did I get so tied up
In this yoga knot
You tell me just how I can take this yoga serious
When all it ever gives to me is a pain in my posteriors
Stand upside down on your head, feet against the wall
A simple yoga exercise done by one and all
Now cross your eyes and hold your breath, look just like a clown
Yoga's sure to catch you if you come falling down
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, man have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely man have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa
Or is it your way to hide a broken heart
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art
La la la la......
Though you are gone, I still wear your ring
They're playing the song we used to sing
Echoes of love, echoes of love
Are coming to me out of the past
The letters you wrote I treasure them so
And I hear your voice wherever I go
In the rustle of a breeze; in the patter of the rain
In the rushing of the seas, all I hear is your name
Come back my love and once you are near
Darling I know no more will I hear
Because you'll be with me right in my heart
Cause you'll be with me right in my heart
Tweedle, tweedle, tweedle dee
I'm as happy as can be
Jimminy cricket, Jimminy Jack
You make my heart go clickety-clack
Tweedle dum, tweedle do
Give it up, give it up
Give your love to me
Tweedle do, tweedle dot
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme all the love you got
I'm a lucky so-and-so
Mercy, mercy, pudding pie
You got something that money can't buy
Tweedle, tweedle dee
Give that kiss to me before you go
Mercy, mercy, who needs you?
I'm gonna keep my eyes on you
Oh, tweedle dee, tweedle do
It's no fun being lonely
...
Morning must come
Knowing, knowing there's no one for me
.....
Knowing, knowing there's no one waiting for me
See how they run
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Saturday morning arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creep in like a nun
Friday's child forget to tie his suitcase
Wonder if you're having fun making ends meet
Come hear my serenade, my desert serenade
A lover's melody, to bring you close to me
It's a tender lullaby, born of golden sand and sky
The song is new, and it's calling you
Tonight beside the desert palms
Come let me take you in my arms
Wherever lovers dwell, it weaves its magic spell
Soon a thousand dreams will start
And romance will fill your heart
My lips conceal love that's warm and real
Give me the chance to hold you near
You'll see a brand new world appear
So come and hear, my desert serenade, my desert serenade
My desert serenade
Let's take the phone off the hook
Turn the lights way down low
Baby put down that book
Tell the maid to go
Do not disturb
Hang the sign on the door
It's time to make love
And I can't wait anymore
I'll just pull down the blind
Now come over here
I've got one thing in mind
Let's get comfortable dear
Everything's right tonight
Mmmm, it's great when we kiss
Now your arms hold me tight
Let's stay like this
I want a barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad
Won't you play for me a down home country song
Because when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off
With a barefoot ballad you just can't go wrong
Give me a honk-tonk fiddle with a guitar in the middle and a melody
Humming like a fountain swinging out on Smokey mountain
Now the big toe's connected to the two toes
And the two toe's connected to the three toe
And the three toe's connected to the four toe
And the four toe's connected to the five toe
And the five toe and away we go
I want to barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad
Won't you play for me a barefoot ballad song
Some like their women short, some like them tall
I'll take them any size cause I love them all
I'm just wild about smorgasbord
I got a craving for smorgasbord
A little kiss here, a little kiss there
That's smorgasbord
Mm
Some take just apple pie, some take just cake
I'll take the dish I please, please the dish I take
Some like just southern belles, they got a one track mind
I go for all the belles except the wedding kind
I'll take them any size cause I love them all, Mm
Aha-ha hurry, hurry step this way
Now the show you're gonna see is strictly high class
There'll be ten hula dancers shaking their grass
So step right up and put your money down
This way to Carny Town
We got a man so skinny you can see his bones
We play on his ribs like a xylophone
With a pair of spoons we get a Rockin' song
You'll hear it all, in Carny Town
Hurry, hurry, hurry, the house is almost full
We got a two headed cow and that's no bull
There's a man who swallows swords and he never gets hurt
He eats razor blades for dessert
He's just about the sharpest guy around
You'll see him here, in Carny Town
Aha-ha I say we're gonna win
I said hurry up
It's been so long darling since I gazed into your eyes
It's been so long darling but now I realize
And just 'cos by seeing you it hurts me through and through
It's been so long darling that I'm back to you
You're gonna set me on fire
I don't know which way to go
Dark moon, way up high up in the sky
Oh, tell me why, oh tell me why
You've lost your splendor
Dark moon, what is the cause your life withdraws
Is it because, is it because I've lost my love
Mortals have dreams of love's perfect schemes
But they don't realize, their love can sometimes bring the
What is the cause your light withdraws
Stop where you are
Don't move an inch
Don't come any closer now baby
You'll be in a pinch
Don't start what you can't finish
I warn you what's in store
If it's love you're looking to get
You're going to get what you're looking for
You'd better freeze
Don't pull the fire now baby
Don't be a tease
I told you once before
Don't you know, you're walking on dangerous ground
Listen babe when I make love
I just don't fool around, no I don't
I just don't play around
Just take it slow
Once I put my hands on you baby
I won't let you go
One kiss and I want more
You're going to be in a pinch
And the grass won’t pay no mind
The moment we’re living is now
And if you ever say good-bye
If you ever even try
I'm gonna tell my mama, tell my papa too
If you ever say good-bye
I am yours and you are mine, come what may
Love like ours remains divine, come what may
Even though we're miles apart
You're living in my lonely heart
At night the teardrops start and pour the long long day
I keep your picture near me since you went away
I plant a kiss upon your lips each night and day
Bear in mind and you will find a heart that is true
And I'll be here with you come what may
Ah um bop a bop a um bop a bop a come what may
As you travel alone on the jericho road
ELVIS I would take Young JOHNNY CASH to do this
Does the road seem all long and heavy your load
Just take it to CHRIST your sins all confess
On the Jericho Road your heart He will bless
On the Jericho Road
First time I fell in love
I fell in love with you
First time I dared to dream
My only dream came true
Must be beginner's luck
To wish upon a star
That opened up my eyes
And there you are
I wave no magic wand
I own no lucky charms
How then can I explain
An angel in my arms
What else can it be
When someone wonderful as you
Loves me
I've got to find my baby
I wonder where can she be
Has anybody seen her
Send her back to me
She left me here all alone
And I ain't had no loving
Since my baby's been gone
My baby's gone
I got to hold her tight and tell her I love her
Tell her everything's all right
So I'll keep searching
All night long
Got to find my baby
I see my light, I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
I shall be released
I see my light come shining
Everybody listen to me
Put a smile on your face
There's no reason to be gloomy
This world's a wonderful place
So when I say again happy
Shout it out
Yeh, get happy now shout it out
Well there is no doubt you've a lot to shout about
Give a yell life is swell shout it out
Hey there little girl don't be sad
There's such good times to be had
Count your blessings one by one
Life's a ball, after all have some fun
I said C'mon get happy, shout it out
Now there's good feeling you can taste
While there's music life's no waste
While there's great things happening
There's no end to the joy life can bring
As long as there's somebody you can love
As long as bright stars shine above
You've got no reason to be blue
Think what it means when all your dreams come true
I said now there is no doubt you've a lot to shout about
There is no doubt you've a lot to shout about
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing the things you used to do
As I was motivatin' over the hill
I saw Maybellene in a coup de ville
A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford
The cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five
She's bumper to bumber rollin' side by side
The cadillac moved to a hundred and four
Got hot and wouldn't do no more
It got cloudy and started to rain
Tooted my horn in the passing lane
The rain water blowin all under my hood
I knew that was doin' my motor no good
The motor cooled down, the heat went down
And that's when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead
The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
And I caught Mabellene at the top of the hill
Everybody come aboard The Showboat tonight
We're gonna dance 'till the morning light
We'll have fun the whole night long
There'll be jokes and songs
Forget your troubles, forget your strife
You'll have the best time of your life
Hey everyone let's go, on with the show
Everybody's gonna gamble on The Showboat tonight
The big casino's lit up bright
How can you lose just wear a grin you'll be sure to win
Lady Luck's waiting there inside
The wheel of fortune's about to ride
Hey everyone let's go on with the show
Way down by the levee, the boats at the bank
Bring money to spend your welcome my friend
Just walk up the plank
Everybody come aboard the showboat tonight
Look around at the happy sight
We'll guarantee that you'll have a ball
Come on one and all
Well what a great night you've got in store
You'll wanna keep coming back for more
What a great night you've got in store
You're gonna keep coming back for more
Some people think that pot of gold
Is all they ever want to hold
But there's a treasure, I think more of
Measure for measure  I'll take love
Some people think that their success
Is all they need for happiness
But there's a pleasure, I think more of
Pound for pound oh yeah and
Ounce for ounce love is all that really counts
So let them have their wealth and fame
Eat caviar and drink champagne
You're all the treasure I'm dreaming of
I'll take love, I'll take love
Say you're mine, then ask me what you will
All your dreams, my darling I'll fulfill
Golden coins, I will bring to you
Silver trinkets and rubies too
In return dear I'm begging you
For the pleasures of love
I'll bring gifts, like you never saw
Priceless garments that you'll adore
Persian rugs to enhance your floor
Darling, choose anything you please
Rich brocade, or woven tapestries
In exchange, I plead on my knees
For the pleasure of love
Golden coins, I'll place at your feet
Precious jewels to make life complete
All my treasures are yours my sweet
Shake the little tambourine
Shake a-ring a jing -jing a-ling
Shake, shake my little dancing queen
Shake that tambourine, that tambourine
I can hear them dancing, in the marketplace
Swishing and a-swirling, in their silks and lace
Bracelets keep a-clinking, on their tiny feet
And with their tambourines they keep the beat
Rings on their fingers, bells on their toes
They make music, wherever they go
Pound that little drum now, tap on it with your thumb
I heard their talent open palace doors
Every night they're dancing, on those marble floors
Kings may bow before them, but they'll be my own
Then they'll shake their thing for me alone
I'm gonna leave right now
Goin' home to the girl that I adore
I'm gonna call right back
Call her back and say I'm comin' home and stay
Hearts made of stone will never break
'Cause your love is never there, they just don't care
You can ask and plea, please, please, please work
And all your love is there to stay
These hearts of stone will cause you pain
Although you love there has stopped just the same
But they'll say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You daddy know, I thought I knew hearts made of stone
Cause they'll say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Girls in kimonos, shy little flowers
Smiling from beneath their parasols
Dainty little moonbeams, delicate as china
Gentle little oriental dolls
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, A-hu
Froggy went a-courtin’ and he did ride, A-hu
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride
He had a nick-nack-nack by his side, A-hu, A-hu, A-hu
He had old Jerry by his side, A-hu, A-hu, Oh yeah
I said see, see, see rider
Oh, see what you have done
Oh girl, you made me love you
Well Lordy I shall not be, I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's growin' in the meadow (down by the water)
I shall not be moved
I'm on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved
On my way to glory land I will not be moved
I'm like a tree that's planted by the water
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
Well I'm on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved
On my way to glory land I shall not be moved
Oh well
On this rock of ages, I shall not be moved
Glory, glory, glory Hallelujah, I shall not be moved
Glory Hallelujah, I shall not be moved
Baby let me be
Your lovin teddy bear
Oh let me be
Your teddy bear
Cause tigers play too rough
Just wanna be, your teddy bear
Oh let me be
Baby let me be, around you every night
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of
Come on over here and love me
I really love you baby, cross my heart
And let us say I do
Today I passed you on the street
And my heart was at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
A memory from the past came slowly stealing
As I braced your arm and walked so close to you (yeah)
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you
We never got discouraged, we never had a doubt
'Cos sooner or later talent must win out
Look out Broadway, we're coming fast
Now we're gonna see our names in lights at last
No more hot dogs at Sloppy Joe's
We're gonna dine on steak and wine at Delmonico's
Rich or poor it's great to have dough
That's one thing we know
Lots of fun, lots of laughs
Signing cheques and contracts and autographs
We're up for N-E-W Y-O-R-K
Look out, look out Broadway
I wanna see all the hustle and bustle
Maybe I can get a date with Lillian Russell
I want to go out with Diamond Jim
Yeah, if he gives you a diamond what will you give to him
Blow the trumpets and beat on the drum
Big time here we come
No more cheap hotels and one night stands
We'll knock Tin Pan Alley flat on its pans
They'll see that we've got class with a capital K
Look out!
Just like an old grandfather's clock that won't stop running
Like an old racehorse that just won't ever quit
There'll be no end to loving you
Nothing can stop me once I start
'Cos I'm a one track mind and a one track heart
Well I'm as stubborn as a mule I just won't let up
Like an old bloodhound Ill hang around your trail
Don't try to stop me if you're smart
Oooo- eeeee there'll be no turning back
Oooo- eeeee I'm gonna stay on your track
Just like a choo-choo train that's gotta keep a-chugging
You'll find that I'm the kind who sticks to what I do
There'll be no end to loving you, baby we'll never be apart
Oh you can take a whole lot of sand
And build a castle on the beach
And though you mold it and you plan
Still you got nothing in your reach
One little slip and it tumbles down
One wrong step and it crumbles all around
Like a house without love, that's sure to fall apart
A house of sand is an empty work of art
You can build a tower of clay
But if you ask my advice
Well it is worthless as I say
I got no heart it's cold as ice
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I don't have the laugh
I used to weep
Now I long for yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
To taking the world upon your shoulder
Na na na na na...
(You) Where, o where are you
Tell me where are you
Where are the nights we spent together
Where is your promise
That you will leave me never
I've been blue the whole day through
Where o where are you
Shall I stay? Would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you
Gentleman songsters off on a spree
Doomed from here to eternity
Lord have mercy on such as we
Baa Baa Baa
Fool, fool, fool
That I was to fall for you
Well, fool, fool, fool
Well, I know what a fool I was
To think that you could love me, too
Well, well, when I first met you, baby
Well, I knew I couldn't win
But I just kept right on trying
'Cause trying is no sin
What a fool, fool, fool
Well, when I first met you, baby
What a fool that I was to fall for you
To think that you could love me too
Oh Jonah he was desperate
In the belly of the whale
Well jonah had a plan
He knew he couldn't fail
He raised his head on high
And looking for the sky
And he sang his song so pretty
The whale told him goodbye
You got to sing you children sing
Sing you children sing
I only know one thing, hey! hey! hey!
Sing you children sing, everybody
Sing your troubles away
Well, Moses said good lord
Open up these waters for me
So I can get your chidren
Across the salty sea
Well the Lord parted the waters
And singing hand in hand
Moses and the children
Walked over to the promised land
Sing you children sing (Hallelujah)
Oh Joshua had a plan
At the walls of Jericho
He'd march around those walls
And on his horn he'd blow
That horn would play a tune
And sing a happy song
When Joshua got through
Those walls came tumbling down
You got to sing your troubles away
You've got to sing your troubles away
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
'cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
The child needs a helping hand
The young man breaks the rules
He buys a gun, steals a car
As her young man dies
Show me Thy ways, O Lord
Help me love when I'm hated
Spread joy unabated
Jesus was more than just a man from Galilee
Christ, the son of God, he died for you and me
They discouraged him and walked him upon in delight
Still Jesus loved them, forgave and He cried
I still remember lovin' you a lot and touchin' you
Only bringin' it back, only just bringin' it back
Everything's bringin' it back, good songs bringin' it back
'Cause I've hurt you so, you know your sorrow shows
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
Don't talk to strangers on the bus
You know that could be dangerous
Don't walk on sticks or stones
Don't answer ringing phones
You know I've got to worry
Til you bring your groovy self on home to me
Don't take up with no alley cats
They really don't know where it's at
Don't fall or trip on things
Stay away from happenings
Be careful walking down the street
You never know what you might meet
Don't change a thing or two
I'm hung up child on you
And you know I got to worry
Until you bring your groovy self on home to me
Get your groovy self on home
See them tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Cares of the past are behind
No where to go, but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind
I know when night has gone
That a new world born at dawn
I抣l keep rolling along
Deep in my heart is a song
Here on the range I belong
I'll keep rolling along
I'm beginning to forget you
That old heartache is gone
I'm beginning to sleep at night
No more crying 'till dawn
I can hear your name mentioned
And it brings no misery
I'm beginnin to forget you
Like you forgot me
I'm beginning to smile again
After crying for so long
I can hear the tune we loved so well
And it's just another song
I'm so happy that it's over
I'm so thankful to be free
Is your love, darling, just a mirage?
From the distance, you call to me like an oasis
Though your kisses keep drawing me near
Is your love a mirage that will disappear?
Like a man in the desert, I'm lost
Is this dream just a trick of my imagination
Though I thirst for your lips, night and day
Is your love a mirage that will fade away?
How I pray, heaven answered my prayer
When I reach out for you, You'll be there
And the search for my love will be through
Like a dream a mirage, will come true
In the search for my love will be through
A mirage, a mirage, a mirage
The shooting stars are coming out of your eyes
They point the way, the way to paradise
I got a funny feeling, I can't be wrong
It won't be long until the sparks will fly
It won't be long
I hear a buzz, buzz around in my brain
But what it does, is bound to drive me insane
At a time like this I must be strong
It won't be long till the sky falls down
Love has taught me plenty, I'm still learning more
Anything worth having is worth the waiting for
Here I go, I'm on a one way trip
Look out below because I'm about to flip
I tell you when these lips get to that kiss
It won't be long until we're out of this world
It won't be long, it won't be long until we're out of this world
If you're in Arizona, I'll follow you
If you're in Albuquerque, I'll be there too
We'll have a little chance to start a-new
Because my love is endless for you
My heart cries for you
Sighs for you, dies for you
My arms long for you
Please come back to me
An unimportant quarrel
Is what we had
We have to learn to live with the good and bad
Come together da da da la dum....
This loneliness is driving me mad
Please come back, come back, come back to me
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland
Oh I wish I was in Dixie, away, away
He claim he got married but he havin' lots of fun

A-whole lot-ta shakin' goin' on
Beware of a gal in britches
Yo-di-o-di-o
Never trust no gal in britches
No-di-o-di-o
If you had a sense of this here horse
You would have known it by now of course
Who wears the britches is the boss
That's a gal, that's a gal in britches
Don't mess with a gal in britches
No feminine gal wears britches
She'll beg you to come to the country dance
You ride twenty miles for the big romance
She shows up in her brother's pants
What'd you expect from a girl in britches
Yo-di-o-di-o-i-ay, It's none of my misfortune
Yo-di-o-di-o-di-ay, Just thought you'd like to know
Don't marry no gal in britches
You'll never know which is which's
She'll put a halter through your nose
Have you cooking and washing clothes
While she goes chasing them buffaloes
Bet your boots, that's a gal in britches
I'll hold you tight in the moonlight tonight
I love you Mary Lou Brown
Twinkeling stars told the milky white way
That I marry Mary Lou Brown
And I will tell all the world
Of my young Southern girl
See her tonight beyond moonlight
So I can hold Mary tight
I'll bring my guitar to the moonlight tonight
Imagine your heart floating right up the sigh (?)
Down by the green river side with my arms open wide
I'll wait for her, only for her
Mary Lou Brown's mine tonight
If I loved you
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go
Only to tell you
But afraid and shy
I let my golden chances pass me by
Soon you'll leave me
Ought (?) you would go in a misty day
Never, never let you know
I love you eternally
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?
And even longer since I felt like your man
'Cause if you don't want the love I can give you
Well there's a honky tonk angel who will take me back in
You never look at me and say "I love you"
How much more do you think I can stand
Oh, there's an old friend out there and she's waiting
Lord she's happy just holding my hand
Yes, there's a honky tonk angel who will take me back in
Oh, Rock of ages, hide Thou me
There is no other refuge
Can save but thee
Through this old world
I've wandered so far, far from thee
Then I cry
Ooh, rock of ages
Hide thou me
(Well now you'd better run)
Run when I say, somebody's calling you
You'd better run
Run when I say, (somebody's calling you)
I feel like my time has long gone
Long gone, (my time is long gone)
Well now goodbye false pretender
Lord I cannot wait for you
For the bible declares you're goin' to heaven Lord
What the bible declares you do
Long gone
Well I met a false pretender
Whose head was bending Lord
I met him in the evening
He was headed down that long lonesome road
Get away from here, somebody's calling you
Long gone, (my time is long gone), long gone
An old cowboy went ridin' out
On a dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as
He went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd
Of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowing through the ragged skies
And up the cloudy draw
Their brands were still on fire and
Their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shining and
Their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as
They thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard
And he heard their mournful cry:
Yippee-yi-yo, yippee-yi-ya
Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat
They're riding hard to catch that herd
But they ain't caught 'em yet
'cause they've got to ride forever on
That range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on hear their cry:
As the riders loped on by him
He heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell
Ridin' on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today
Or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies
Now come along with me
We'll do the plantation rock
It's easy as can be
You'll wanna dance round the clock
Well it became a sensation
Rockin' on the plantation
Dancin' in the fields down to each dock
Now do the plantation rock
So come on bend your knees
Twist with ease side to side
Like the swaying trees keep in rhythm
Now have some pep double step
Shake right there like a rockin' chair
And stay with them
Well now you're right at home
Doin' the plantation rock
Just do it as you were shown
Well just like on the plantation
Folks all over the nation
Started rockin' on each street and block
Gonna do the plantation rock
Do the plantation rock
Long after this endless summer has gone
I'll be lonely oh so lonely
Living only to remember you
I'll remember too
Your voice as soft as the warm summer breeze
To your arms someday I'll return to stay
Just look right in my face
I was born standing up
My daddy was a green-eyed mountain jack
Because I'm evil, my middle name is misery
Well I'm evil, so don't you mess around with me
Because I'm evil, my middle name is misery
Well I'm evil, so don't you mess around with me
I'm evil, evil, evil, as can be
I'm evil, I'm evil, evil, evil
Left my mama a goodbye note
For the next three weeks I went huntin' them nights
Just lookin' for a place to play
Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire
Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis
I run outta money and luck
Started pickin' out some o' them all night bars
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar
Makin' music on my guitar
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
A little four-piece band was jammin'
I showed 'em what a band would sound like
With a swingin' little guitar man
Show 'em, son
Diggin' the finest little five-piece group
Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band
Well, wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man
Play "Trouble/Guitar Man"
The cattle are prowlin' and the coyotes are howlin'
Way out where the dogies bawl
Where spurs are a-jinglin' a cowboy is singin'
This lonesome cattle call
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo
He rides in the sun, till his days work is done
And he rounds up the cattle each fall
Singin' his cattle call
For hours he will ride on the range far and wide
When the night wind blows up a squall
His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather
He sings his cattle call
He's brown as a berry from ridin' the prairie
And sings with an ol' western drawl
No no no no no no no no baby, I ain't asking much of you
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk of love will do
You're about to starve me half to death
Well you can spare a kiss or two and
Well I ain't greedy baby
I got wishbone in my pocket
I got a rabbit's foot around my wrist
You know I'd have all the things these lucky charms could bring
If you'd give me just one sweet kiss, no no no no no no no
Write to me from Naples
Tell me all that's new
I loved you in Naples
More than words can say
Call me cara mia
Keep my heart with you
I can hear a mandolino
Softly it cries
While I raise a glass of vino
Praising your eyes
Since we said a rivederci
My poor heart cries
Just for a letter from you
Please come back, come back to me
We couldn't make believe
Lala la make believe
But your love dear
Lala could pretending couldn't you
Couldn't I, couldn't we
Make believe our lips are blended
In a special kiss
For to love me miles away
Make believe I love you
For to tell my true, I do
Do you remember the love we had for each other
I was your faithy...
Please believe me when I tell you
I just can't stand to see you go, you know
Please understand just how I feel
Your love for me might not reveal
And if you know this time it's real
We understood (?)
Come back to me, my love is real
And you will know this timeless feel
Will understand
You're the one who beckoned the wind
And fanned the flame when our love began
So don't pretend you don't know me
Our names are carved on you, singing tree
Oh singing tree
Sing to me
Call your friend
The roving wind
Maybe he can find my love
And bring her back, singing tree
Your leaves have turned from green to blue
Sometimes I think you loved her too
But since she left and our love died
You stand petrified, singing tree
I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in
Well then a little light from heaven healed my soul
Well, he bathed my heart in love, and wrote my name above
Well just a little talk with my Jesus gonna it right
We'll just have a little talk with Jesus
We're gonna tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our fainted cry
He will answer by and by
Oh well, when you feel a little prayer wheel turning
And you will know a little fire is burnin'
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
You may have doubts and fears
Your eye be filled with tears
Oh well my Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
Well he wrote my name above, and he bathed my heart in love
Oh well just a little talk with my Jesus gonna make it right
Let us have a little talk with my Jesus
Please let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry
Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning
You'll know just a little fire is burnin'
And have a little talk with my Jesus gonna makes it right
Well you may have doubts and fears
Oh well now my Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
Well you go to Him in prayer
He answers my every prayer
Oh well just a little talk with my Jesus gonna makes it right
Now let us have a little talk with my Jesus
Tell Him all about our troubles
And I know he's gonna answer by and by
You'll know a little fire is burnin'
Make it right
Three to get ready, now go, cat, go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes
You can burn my house, steal my car
Our Father, Who Art in Heaven
Hallowed be, Thy Name
Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be Done
On earth, as it is, in Heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors
And lead us not into temptation,but deliver us from evil
For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory forever
Amen
Instrumental
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
You ain't never caught a rabbit
Ahhhhhhhhhh (ahhhh)
Our little girl had taken sick one evening
As she walked home from shcool
And then her deathbed soon claimed her
It made us so sad and so blue
Then she called me close to her bedside
And whispered these words soft and low
Tell mommy to come to me quickly
I want to kiss you both and go
I hear a sweet voice calling
Way up in Heaven on high
God has made room for your daughter
Oh mommy and daddy dont cry
Take care of little brother
Tell him I'm gone to rest
I know his little heart is broken
He's all that you have left
Then she closed eyes forever
Never to see us no more
Until we meet our darlin
On that bright and peaceful shore
I'm about to roll over you
I'm a napalm-bomb
I’m on your side, oh when time gets rough
When you're down and out, when you’re on the streets
Tear it all apart
If you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
I would beg and steal
(Beg and steal)
Just to feel
(Just to feel)
Your heart
(I want your heart)
Beating close to mine
(So close to mine)
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
(He would beg and steal)
(Yes, just to feel)
This hour of love we share
There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
Stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Love me tender
Love me sweet
Love me true
Love me long
Love me dear
(When at last my dreams come true
Darling this I know
Happiness will follow you
Everywhere you go)
Play it Jerry, play it ...
I got my mojo workin' I got my mojo workin'
Hands off of her unless you want deal with me
Get your hands off of her, she don't belong to you
Yeah, I got my mojo workin' I got my mojo workin'
I said I've made up my mind, yes I did
To live in memory
Of such an lone-, lonely time
And I can't stop wanting you
... remember alone in my heart
Call back my love of San Antonio
Just pretend like tales fall apart
Think once again of my love, my own
A few words not known .... my heart I belong...
I don't know... of my rose in San Antonio
Growing all this tender lala heart
Call back my love in San Antonio
It's so sweet and tender like peddles fall apart...
Rose in San Antonio... know my rose in San Antonio
He saw Aunt Mary comin' and he
Ducked back in the alley
Bridge
Your Mama can't dance and your Daddy don't rock and roll
But when evening comes around and it's time to hit the town
Where do you go
Flip, flop and fly
I dont care if I die
Dont ever leave me
Dont ever say goodbye
Was dancin to the jailhouse rock
You ain't nothin but a hound dog
Cryin all the time
They say everything can be replaced
They say every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here
They say every man needs protection
They say that every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere so high above this wall
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him shouting so loud
Crying out that he was framed
Keep your hands off of her
She don't belong to you
She's mine, o mine, no matter what I do
She's long, lean and lanky
Tadadadaadaaa
Hands off of her, she don't belong to you
Well, it's down at the end of lonely street
You make me so lonely baby
It wasn't me who changed, but you
And now you've gone away
But don't you know that now you're gone
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug
I'm in love
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
My heart beats so it scares me to death!
That's to have that girl that I love so fine!
I found my thrill on blueberry hill
On blueberry hill when I found you
The moon stood still on blueberry hill
And lingered until my dreams came true
I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind
Of such an old lonesome time
I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
That we once knew
Heals a broken heart
And I love you so
Love me true
For my darling I love you
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
Chorus]
That's all right mama, just anyway you do
Well, that's all right, that's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you do
Like before in your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it
But baby, baby I know it
I'm going to tell you a little story, so you'll understand where I'm talking about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods and the fields
Chinc, chinc, chinc, chin, ling, ling
Haven't ever lost one minute of sleeping
Worried about the way things might have been
None
Oh well I guess I'm doing fine
It's been so long now and it seems that
