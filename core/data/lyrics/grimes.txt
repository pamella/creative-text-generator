I got in a fight, I was indisposed
I was in, despite all the wicked prose
But I'm only a man, and I do what I can
I got friends in high places
I get out for free
I got in a fight but they don't know me
'Cause I'm only a man
And I do what I can
B-E-H-A-V-E
Arrest us
Italiana mobster
Looking so precious
Never more
You gave up being good when you declared a state of war
Eh
I don't behave, I don't behave, oh eh
I don't behave, I don't behave, oh
Are you going to the party?
Are you going to the show?
'Cause I'm only a man, do what I can, oh
'Cause I'm only a man, do what I can
Are you going to the party? Are you going to the show?
I did something bad, maybe I was wrong
Sometimes people say that I'm a big time bomb
But I'm only a man
Oh, the fire it's all right
'Cause we can make 'em all go crazy
We can make 'em wanna die
The people touch it
I can't touch it
Even though it's mine
(Are you going to the party? Are you going to the show?)
My heart, I never be, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know
My
Ever see, ever be, ever know my heart
Home, and I know
Playing the deck above
It's always different
I'm the one in love
(I'm the one in love)
Ever see, ever be, ever know
I never walk about after dark
It's my point of view
'Cause someone could break your neck
Coming up behind you
Always coming and you'd never have a clue
I never looked behind all the time
I will wait forever
Always looking straight
Thinking counting all the hours you wait
See you on a dark night
And no, I'm not a jerk
I would ask if you could help me out
It's hard to understand
'Cause when you're runnin' by yourself
It's hard to find someone to hold your hand
And know it's good to be tough like me
But I would wait forever
I need someone else
To look into my eyes and tell me
"Girl, you know you've got to watch your health"
La la la la la
Oh, ah-ah
You claw, you fight, you lose
Got a doll that looks just like you
Remember when we used to say
"I love you" almost every day
I saw the light in you, you know
Going out as I close our window
You never liked me anyway
Aye yeah, aye yeah
Aye, I don't see the light I saw in you before
And no, I don't
And no, 
I don't care anymore
(Now you’ll never know)
Baby, believe me
And you had every chance
You destroy everything that you know
(Uncontrollable)
If you don't need me
Just let me go
You hate, you bite, you lose
After all, I just don't like you
It's nice that you say you like me
But only conditionally
Your voice, it had the perfect glow
It got lost when you gave it up though
Cause you want money, you want fame
Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, sing along, baby
Then your heart beats on this sad song
Underground, underneath me
And the big things we could’ve had
Hey, hey, oh no
(Then your heart beats underground now)
Ah
Get up, this is what I see
When we were young, we used to get so close to it
And you were scared and you were beautiful
I wanna peer over the edge and see in death
If we are always the same
Oh, I fear that no life will ever be like this again
'Cause your love kept me alive and it made me insane, oh, yeah
There were moments when it seemed okay
(But I go back alone)
Whether you go or whether you stay
(I go back alone)
There was a time when the music would play
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time
Oh, when I get up, this is what I see
Welcome to reality
If we are always the same, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
To reality
Oh, baby, every (Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
It sounds like corporate art
Break bread with an infidel
And plunge into the dark
I'm, like, begging for it, baby
Makes you wanna party, wanna wake up
Baby, it's violence, violence
Baby, it's violence
But you can't see what I see
You can't see what I see
'
Cause you, ha, ha, you feed off hurting me
Off hurting me, yeah, ha
Baby, it's violence
But you can't see what I see
You can't see what I see
'Cause you, ha, ha, you feed off hurting me
Off hurting me, yeah, ha-ha
You wanna make me bad, make me bad
And I like it like that, and I like it like that
You wanna make me bad? Pay me back
Said, "I like it like that," said, "I like it like that"
Off hurting me, yeah
You wanna make me, make me
Make-make me, make me, make-make me, make me
You wanna pay me, pay me
Pay me back-back, pay me back
And I like it like that
Hey, oh why you looking at me? (Against the music)
Hey, oh why you looking at me? (Baby I can use it)
(Pitty pat, doing that, talking smack, got my back
Pitty pat, call it black, talking smack)
Why you looking at me now?
Why you looking at me again?
What if I pulled my teeth?
Cut my hair underneath my chin
Wrap my curls all around the world
Throw my pearls all across the floor
Feeling my beat like a sniper girl
('Cause I want it more)
Hey, what about me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
(Against the music)
Oh, why you looking at me? (Baby I can use it)
Pitty, pitty, pitty pat
Why you always doing that?
Why you always talking smack?
Yeah, Grimes got my back
Why you always call it black?
Yeah, Grimes-
(Venus fly!)
Hey! What about...
Again...
Again..
(Why you always talking smack...)
Hey!
Baby, I can use it
(All gotta freak, yeah, you a freak!
I said we all gotta freak, yeah, you a freak!
Freak, freak)
Big beats, black cloud
Get it wrong, get loud
Write a song, get down
And everyone will know
And everyone can go
Oh, then, get lost
Take his shit, maybe not
Listen good, he's gone
Everything you know
And everyone should go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I don't need to know
So, do you want to?
Am I just right? (Is it just right?)
Can you see the enemy just isn't me tonight?
Oh, it is perfect
You could be anything out there
Butterflies flying in the air
Oh, no, it came
Higher than an aeroplane
Don't know this song
Sweeter than a sugar cane
Why you looking for a harmony?
There is harmony in everything
It’s a butterfly whose wings span the world
Run away, get caught
Put in cell, livestock
Calculate, old body
Got you moving slow
Big bird, dead man
Wish I could save them
Don't know, no plan
Everyone can go
And nobody can know
Am I just (am I just?)
Can you see the enemy just isn't me?
Oh, baby, it is perfect
So fly away
If you're looking for a dream girl
I'll never be your dream girl
Living in the real world
Looking for a dream girl
Lying so awake, things I can't escape
Lately, I just turn 'em into demons
Flew into the sun, fucking heroin
Lately, I just turn 'em into reasons and excuses
Always down when I'm not up, guess it's just my rotten luck
To fill my time with permanent blue
But I can't see above it, guess I fucking love it
But, oh, I didn't mean to
I see everything, I see everything
Don't you tell me now that I don't want it
But I did everything, I did everything
More lines on the mirror than a sonnet (Woo)
Funny how they think us naive when we're on the brink
Innocence was fleeting like a season
Cannot comprehend, lost so many men
Lately, all their ghosts turn into reasons and excuses
More lines on the mirror than a sonnet
This, this music makes me cry
It sounds just like my soul
Oh, I'm not ready to win
Oh Lord, cause I don't wanna know what they say
Cause I get carried away
Commodifying all the pain
The things they see in me, I cannot see myself
When you get bored of me, I'll be back on the shelf
And when the ocean rises up above the ground
Maybe I'll drown in...
California
You only like me when you think I'm looking sad
I didn't think you'd end up treating me so bad
Oh (ah-ah-ah)
Come Monday, it's a dream (ah-ah-ah)
Broken my own heart again
Chasing something beautiful
Oh Lord, but I don't understand what they say
Oh, I, oh, I
Oh na, na, na, ne
Chinese Characters
藏在肺裡的尖叫
藏在骨頭和肌肉裡的
沒有爆破前 毋庸置疑的
都會揪緊成病
曾經 乾燥的 都被潑濕
膨脹後彈牙 多肉 黏膩多汁
一個女人徒手拔掉滿頭黑髮
在夢境的山稜線行走
思念聚集成蚊蟲
張開沒有焦點的瞳孔
就像….快 張開沒有欲望的大腿
我咬下去 你還是無動於衷嗎
明明可以叫出來的呀
沿著你的脊椎走
我的手指 戳出一個冰涼的湖
四處張望 無人看守
暴露狂脫掉風衣 淚流滿面地 跳進去
計劃把你高潮的尖叫聲錄起 來
卻發現剛剛按錯了鍵
一去不復返 無能重複那時刻
你躺著
和逐漸冰冷的液體 撕扯著
黏膩 透明 在我的手心開出具有彈性的花
我覺得不夠 想從你身體裡擠出更多
就在這個時候電話響起
窗外的鹿群 飛奔離去 同時
急遽消退 藍色的風 抹去世界邊緣的泡沫
從你半開的雙眼繞過
接起電話 靜默降臨
剛醒來的情慾 在電話裡喘氣 尖叫
我邊聽 邊把你的汗一滴滴舔掉
不能吼出來 那就吞下去

English Translation
The screams that are buried in the lungs
Buried in the bones and the muscles
Unexploded, undeniable
Cram into a sickness
What used to be dry is now sodden
Swollen, meaty, moist and juicy
My teeth are bouncing off it
A woman pulls out the headful of black hair with her bare hands
Walks along the mountain ridges in a dream
Remembrance swarms like mosquitos
Opening up the unfocused eyes
As if… Quick, spread the legs without desire wide
I take a bite, are you still unmoved
You can scream out
Tracing along your spine
My fingers created a cold lake
I look around, no one is guarding
The exhibitionist takes out his coat
And jumps into it with tears on his face
I planned to record your scream as you reached orgasm
But then realize that I’ve pressed the wrong button
The moment has been lost, irretrievable
You lie there
Struggling with the body fluid that is getting cold
Sticky, transparent, elastic flowers in my palm
I’m not satisfied; I want to squeeze more out of your body
The telephone rings at this moment
A herd of deer run past the window and at the same time
Blue winds are dispelled so quickly, wiping out the foams on the margin of the world
Escaping from your half-opened eyes
Picking up the phone, silence comes
The desire just awoken breathes and screams in the receiver
As I listen I lick away every drop of your sweat
If you can’t scream then swallow it down
I got a big dream, small world in between
Me and everything I can't do
Not really that great, just okay and kinda fake
You sucked the life right out of the room
I know most likely
How I used to be a frail and silly thought in your mind
Don't be unkind
You're so far behind me
But I can't see something more
Than the things you try to take
Now, who made a mistake?
Don't you cry
It's mine
I saw the parade, big band, masquerade
So what brings you now to my feet?
Back at the first page, nothing gained for you but age
Oh, nothing else could be more complete
Call me unkind
Dim the light
In your head, in your heart, in your hiding emotion
Where the waters meet?
In the head, in the heart, in your hiding emotion
If I stare into the darkness, I won’t know where I am
I haven’t seen the daylight since I started giving in
My eyes are falling heavy, my feet are moving slow
Am I main fature not in the stone
We appreciate power
We appreciate power, power
What will it take to make you capitulate?
Elevate the human race, putting makeup on my face
Simulation, give me something good
God's creation, so misunderstood
Pray to the divinity, the keeper of the key
One day, everyone will believe
When will the state agree to cooperate?
People like to say that we're insane
But AI will reward us when it reigns
Pledge allegiance to the world's most powerful computer
Simulation: it's the future
And if you long to never die
Baby, plug in, upload your mind
Come on, you're not even alive
If you're not backed up on a drive
If you're not backed up, backed up on a drive
Neanderthal to human being
Evolution, kill the gene
Biology is superficial
Intelligence is artificial
Submit
Dirt in your fingernails
Blood on your knees
But did that ever make you happy?
I think you were my best friend
Gentle do not reprehend
I know it hasn't been a dream
But if you pardon, I will mend
Drunk in a parking lot
Just after three
Tearin' out your hair like a banshee
Lighter and a safety pin
Light the end, burn the skin
I'll stick to you forever
Cause this scar I think is permanent
Oh
Falling off the edge with you
It was too good to be true
Too good to be true
Bite off your fingernails
Cut up your skin
Tell me that it didn't happen
Running  through the dark woods
Fallen couldn't see straight
I was only looking for a human to reciprocate
Baby it's a black hole
I need it to breathe
But does it really make you happy?
Kiss me with a big knife
Bloody heart of paradise
Living like a soldier
Peace of mind must be nice
Oh falling off the edge with you
Oh it was too good to be true
Thought I had won
I thought I won til I lost
And I, fixing my fall
But for what cost?
And I see your reflection when I look at mine
And I say (I say, I say)
Baby, don't go away
Angel baby, there is
Nothing I'd rather do
Think I love you, but I know that I will never do
Everything I love becomes everything I do
So, tell me anything, anything you want
You're my darling girl, tell me what's on your mind
Tell me anything, anything you feel like
Anything you feel like
Je comprends
Je l'ai dit
C'est la vie
Oh Montréal, pull apart (I don't mind)
Running every red light, you were right
Oh Montréal, don’t break my heart
I think I love you
Angel baby, you got me feeling kinda blue
Think I need you and you know the things that I would do
Everything I love is consolation after you
So, tell me anything, anything you like
I don’t need no medicine
Gonna dance all night
I’m high on adrenaline
That's right, that's right, that's right
So, we party when the sun goes low
Imminent annihilation sounds so dope
I'm not shy but I refuse to speak
Because I don't trust you to understand me
You know me as the girl who plays with fire
But this is the song I wrote you in the dark
(I hear they're calling my name)
I'm not gonna sleep anymore
The boys are such a bore, the girls are such a bore
I never trust the government and pray to God for sure, yeah
I don't need to sleep anymore
That's what the drugs are for
Every city has a place like this
Underneath the bridges where the tainted kiss
Put on "Bullet with Butterfly Wings"
So that I can sing along while I break things
Ooh, you know me as the girl who plays with fire
Paradise on my right, and h-h-hell on my left
The a-a-angel of death, right behind me
Paradise on my right, h-h-h-hell on my left
And the angel of death, she said to God
"Un-fuck the world, un-fuck the world
You stupid girl, you stupid girl"
Oh, oh
(Anymore, that's what the drugs are for)
O—
Aphrodite
I wrote your constellation
Into the sky
S-s-s-s-s-sa
Suns at night
I'm out late at 4 AM
He says, "How's the weather, baby? How've you been?"
You're gonna get sick, you don't know when
I never doubt it at 4 AM
4 AM, 4 AM
Falling down again
Unraveling
Into the sky, ooh
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, ah
I'm out late at 4 AM (4 AM)
He says, "How's the weather, baby? How've you been?" (How you've been?)
I never doubt it at 4 AM (Doubt it, 4 AM)
I'm out late at 4 AM (Doubt it)
You're gonna get sick (Falling down again), you don't know when
I never doubt it at 4 AM (4 AM)
4 AM, 4 AM, 4 AM, 4 AM
4 AM, 4 AM, falling down again
4 AM, 4 AM, out late at 4 AM
4 AM, 4 AM, 4 AM
I'm out late at 4 AM, oh, oh
Baby I've been lookin' for a diamond
I could never touch it and it shines like ice
Everything is written in the sky and
Baby you can have it if you say it nice
Come on, baby, let's do somethin' ugly
Somethin' you would never touch yourself
Now let it bleed from me
I just wanna see it come out
Are you big? Are you ugly?
Can you kill a man with your hands?
Are you hot? Do you want me?
Think I don't understand?
Baby I've been sleepin' with a rifle
Shotgun, grapeshot, tryptophobe
Baby I got somethin' you can stifle
Tie me, I won't leave
Come on, baby, let's do somethin' pretty
Just let it bleed from me
I just wanna make you come out
What a peace of mind
What a night, what a sight
Cause I walk alone
(Be a body)
I close my eyes until I see
I don't need hands to touch me
Be a body
I lean on walls until I stand
I touch my face with my hand
(To the rhythm I go)
So then what am I?
Eh, eh eh
I, I've been thinking, I've been thinking
I, I could leave the world today
Everybody dies, we anoint their eyes and we dance like angels do
Writing out your name, little shapes that feign some knowledge of you
And you'll never get sad and you'll never get sick
And you'll never get weak
We're deep
In the belly of the beat, yeah!
Everybody dies, we cut out their eyes and we dance like angels do
Making our name in a world that feigns some knowledge of you
You are the only one
Babe, I was so numb
And even though I'm breaking, at least
I feel something (Just like release)
Look, I say
As my fingers tremble
This is what I am
And, and, and you
Fingers tremblin' too
Understand
Yeah, we could play a beautiful game
We could play a beautiful game
You could chase me down in the name
Of love
I wanna play a beautiful game
Even though we're gonna lose
But I adore you
Adore you
Babe, I was so dumb, ooh, ooh
I feel something (How can you be so mean?)
Choose, I say
This is who I am
Unrequited love has reassembled me
I think it's crazy
And if you said I do
I'd reassemble you, baby
And you're so cool
'Cause you don't think you're cool
You can abuse it
Because you made my all-time favorite music
I adore you
So, I ignore you
But there you are, getting away
Think we finally lose
I adore you, oh
You, you
You, you, you
O silly love
Coming here
When I said, "Go"
Weigh me down
O love
Me now
Yeah, oh
So heavy, I fell through the earth
'Cause I fucking love
'Cause I'm full of love from you
So heavy I fell
Through the earth, baby
I could live in the world just like a stranger
I could tell you the truth or a lie
I could tell you that people are good in the end
But why, why would I?
Angels will cry when it's raining
Tears that are no longer clean
What do you mean?
What do you mean, it's all gone?
I've waited here so long
The minds of the people
Have withered to nothing
Know that you’re missing something
You wanna leave the world with me
You wanna leave
Everything I've ever known is wrong
Oh, what's the matter with me?
Did I even want it?
Did I just assume that's how it had to be?
Throw a ball, it's bouncing off the wall
That's how I heard music first
Did I really need it?
How can something so free feel so rehearsed?
Calculate the entropy
Running out of energy
A lack of love or empathy
Leave me lonely
Bitter path in front of me
Oh neither friend or enemy
Every day I let the music play
It seems to play by itself
Did I let it bleed me?
Did I hit it back until it bled itself?
How the birds can sing a tuneless song?
How can they stay in the sky?
Maybe they're just screaming
Maybe it's not music and it's all a lie
E-eh, e-eh, e-eh, eh
E-e-eh, eh
Keep me lonely
Dreams, they feel like memories when I dream of you
Time won't stay, it’ll stretch itself out from a minute to days
And I like to think that we don’t drink to wipe it out
Cause I've been here
Living up, giving up
When I go, can I go with you, you
When I go, can I go with-
Go, go, go, go, go with
(Go with)
Go, go, go, go, go
(Blood diamonds)
Happy scenes, a stupid dream when I dream of you
They don't stay, it might all be delusion, but I couldn't say
And I'd like to think that we don’t drink just to drink, you know
Living up, give it up
Go, can I go with-
Go, can I go with you
Go, go, go, go, go (Go!)
(Can I go, can I go?)
I shot myself yesterday
Got to Heaven anyway
Think I might regret it now
Tie my feet to rocks and drown
If you don't bleed, then you don't die
Cross my heart and hope to fly
If you like it, then you'll make it out alive
If they could see me now, smiling six feet underground
I'll tie my feet to rocks and drown
You'll miss me when I'm not around
Last call, last call
(You'll miss me when I'm not around)
Promise if I make it, I'll kiss you good night
(I'll see you underground)
You'll miss me when I'm down
Hurt myself again today
Doesn't matter anyway
(You'll miss me when I'm gone)
I'll make it to Heaven even if I
Have to climb the clouds and learn to fly
If you don't bleed, then you don't die
Cross my heart and hope to fly
Last call
Fly through the night, fly like everyone I know
Like everyone, I've been conceited
Fly through the night, doesn't matter where you go
When you leave, I feel so defeated
Oh, you don't know where you're from
And you got nowhere to go?
Don't taunt me with your story, cause I've got my own
Never better, just less immediate
You come and go, but I love you so (so)
Easily, I'm the sweetest damn thing you ever saw
Easily, suddenly, you don't know me at all
Easily, three years later and now you wanna call
Easily-y-y-y yeah yeah yeah yeah
Easily (so, you)
Easily-y-y-y
(Oh, no-no-no-no-no)
Lean on the ground with you
On, on my knees
Kneel in the water down low
But you can't go where they all go
Read about me
Not me, not me, it ends with me
When the leaves begin to fall
I try to catch 'em all
Oh baby, I can't say
That everything is okay
Cause I have a problem
And I don't know how to start from
But, baby I can't do
Anything to help you
Cause I’m working to the bone
And your love's gonna save me
Hey, I'ma, hey, I'ma, ready to say, I'ma
Working to the bone all day, I'ma
Hey, I'ma, hey, I'mma, ready to say, I'ma
Oh, baby, I can't say
And I don't know how to stop them
Oh, baby, I can't do
Oh anything to help you
‘Cause I’m working to the bone
And you know, and you know
You're gonna have to play alone
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma
She'd be, she'd be on the sun
Love could always may come and go
Do you wanna say oh
Guys do not wanna say
Anything in front of me
Love do you wanna say oh
Everything I wanna say
I don't wanna say, I don't wanna say
To the night, oh
I’ve been up to run up in the snow
You’ve been liking anywhere to go
They sing in the dark
They're talking to me
And sing in the night
Enlighten the phase
Tonight’s the night
I waited 'til the end
And I will say it’s fair
So it’s underwater
And you got her
You would never let her go
Oh, woah-oh
Do you wanna say, oh
Love do you wanna say, oh
I sleep in the day and dance in the night
Oh, you're all I know
But what can I do if I can't see you? It's too bright
Broken glass that shines like Northern Lights
So I pray, but the world burns
And still, you need to come first
So I don't know where you stand
Are you a man?
Are you something I can't stand?
Hands reaching out for new gods
You can't give me what I want
But what do I know? Oh
What do I know?
I wanna let go, I
I wanna, wanna, wanna let go
I wear black eyeliner, black attire, yeah
So take me higher and higher and higher
But the world is a sad place, baby
Only brand new gods can save me
Only brand new gods
I've been
Oh, I've been waiting destiny
And my heart is here right next to me
And I'm caught waiting in the rain
And I know and I need you in the storm
And I oh-oh-oh-I-I, oh-oh-oh-I-I-I-I
Hey, hey, you want to play
Well baby, I can go and go
And every other day you're running off with so and so
Well baby, I would throw you if I didn't know you
But I'm paying for it
Baby I would throw you, if I didn't know you
I hold on, and I don't care what you say
But the way it goes it's happening everyday
I can see space on the radio
But the way it goes it's still happening everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday-day-y-day-y-day, everyday-y-day-y-day
Everyday-y-day-y-day
Baby, I would throw you if I didn't know you
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
I tease my little ashtray
With a burning cigarette
I don't want to run away
I don't even know you yet
I got everything you want
I can make it feel so wet
I'm a little bit in love with you
I can take your picture, baby
This is the sound of the end of the world
Dance me to the end of the night, be my girl
Madness, intellect, audacity
Truth and the lack thereof
They will kill us, oh, have no doubt
There are many ways in
But there's only one way out
There's only one way out
There's so many ways in
I get lost
Can you get lost with me, baby?
I get lost (I get lost, I get lost)
I get lost (Can you get lost with me, baby?)
(Lost)
(I get lost) (Lost with me, baby?)
(I get lost)
(There's a way through, ooh)
(There's always a way through)
(Ooh-ooh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Soft skin you touch me within
So I know I can be human once again
I know you're faced with something
That could consume you completely
Soft skin you touch me once again
And somehow it stings cause I know it is the end
I hate that you're leaving
So why don't you talk to me?
You act like nothing ever happened
But it meant the world to me
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight in the trees
See the weight of the leaves
See the weight on my heart
(These are our)
(These are our falling secrets)
Soft skin
I’ll have you be near my heart
Until I feel human
Soft skin, oh
You were never in love to begin with
So now I'm suffering
Thinking of her all my life
Now I go down
I cannot feel, I cannot feel
Thinking of her, baby that won't go
Now I go slow
Now I go slow, baby that won't go
(Thinking of her all my life)
We can go slow
We won't go slow
Ah uh ah uh ah uh
Speak it all the time, speak it all the time
And I'll never tell you what is mine
I don't know what it means, but I see it, it's fine
It's hardly any other, it can borrow inside
Think it all the time, think it all the time
And I know that I tell you, but boy its mine
I don't know what it is and that it is fine
It's hardly any other it can borrow inside
Oooh
Being myself makes me feel like I can't touch the ground
Here on the earth makes me feel like I can't get the sound
Being myself makes me feel like I know who you are
Cause boy, you can be what the words
Who you are, what you are
Ah uh ah uh
I don't want to let you go
(ah uh ah uh ah uh)
Ohhh, boy you need to know
Oh, You could be a better friend
Cause I could be a better man
Sometimes you know that I wonder why (up and down up and down)
I don't want to dream but boy I'm lying upside down
Being myself makes me feel like I don't know the trees
Cause boy you can be what you, what you want to be
Ohh, I don't want to let you go
Ohh, you're tying me low
Ohh, you could be a better friend
Ohh, and I could be a better man
I try and try to make you cry
And make you love me
Oh I would say yes
The need to be the best before the need to rest
See, my wait is you
My wait is you
Be in the dark to be in a dark side
Be in a deep mind
To make the pain defuse the flame can be trying
But I would say yes, I would say yes
So as you fade away alive, I lay dying
Oh I would say!
Try this, try this
It's always something
I know you're running and we know, hey
I feel my heartbeat
You tell me nothing
You tell me nothing in this town, no
Go where you want to go
When you get there you'll be wishing you were back home
Oh, go where you want to go
Because the sky is lifting
And I can't stop drifting along
I'm singing with a lifeline
You want a lifeline
I'm singing for you softly
And when you got me
I am gone you know
I will wait for you if you want me to
(It’s all upon my own way, it’s all upon my own, babe
It’s all upon, it’s all I can do)
(When you want to)
It’s all upon, it’s all i can do)
(I will wait for you if you want me to)
(I will wait wait wait, and I’ll go go go, go at night oh)
(I will wait for you if you want me to
(If you want me to)
(I will leave leave leave, and I’ll go go go, go at night oh)
I will wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait, oh
(I will wait, I will wait, I will wait, I will wait, I will wait, I will wait)
Midnight, afternoon
Morning comes, but not too soon
Rosa wakes up in my bed
We are separate
Vampires in our nights aware
I’m no longer happy in there
Rosa, Rosa, Rosa
Oh, where is my heart?
Where is my heart?
I can never tell her
That she is a witch
Sewing up my heart
Get love in equal stitch
Oh, I am not in love
I am not in love
I'm not
Where are my arms?
Morning, morning, morning
Will wake me up cold
Reminds me that I am getting old, oh
Oh, touching
He can't have it
I can tease
Oh, lie with me
Tired of living on my own, baby
Oh, how dear, when I see
(
Have it when it's waiting for you
)
Oh, no, you see the way and I can't see
I can't my baby
You're down, I know
I can't my baby, oh
I can't my baby...
I am on my own
Oh, I don't know how
Oh, be on time oh
Oh, be on time
I won't today
And I will know where I'm from
I don't know how my baby
Here I am, running in the dark
Here I am, running away
All is on the room, all is on the room
All is on the room, and I can’t say
When you’re taking your time
Close your eyes and tell me what you see
The oil and the rain mix with the setting sun
After dark when I can't believe the sun
Could feel the whole world glory in a spotlight
And it fills up the dark
And it fills up the dark, like a new day
Hold on to me
There's something glowing and my blood is bubbling
Ah-ah, ah-oh
And I want to be right now with you
When you and I were being loved
Yeah
Oh, my love, I'll wait
I am waiting here all day
And I'm nothing without you
When you and I were, and I loved you
Oh, my love, I know
That you are asking me to go
And I know I am holding onto dust
But my heart is telling me I'm right
Take my hand if you care
I can be your girl
You'll be my man
But you don't love me anymore
And I've never felt so broken up before
(I am well, I am well, I am well)
Ooh, baby darling
I will wait before
Ooh, long night
Ooh, every night
I will wait before, before
I die, I die, I die, I
Take my hand if you can
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh, my darling
Near the water
I, I sing my songs, I play
I, I know, I play it myself
Oh, you know
What have you done?
I've made my head and I don't see nothing
You go ahead and I know it's nothing
1, 2, 3
I can't see
And I, baby I don't wanna know
It's been sad, I can't sleep
But right now I don't wanna know
Boy, I can't see
Everything in front of me
But, baby, I am ready to go
Anyone who knows me knows that when I'm 
But, baby, I'm ready to go
Boy, I can't hear
Everything you're telling me
I got the power
I-I-I-I know
I banged my head and I see
I don't care
I played with my mind in that game
I can't, I don't care
Ah, my sister
Hold my hand in the night
Tick tock, baby, ah
Ladies walk about, singing in the night
You will never tell
I will cry on the 4th of July, and
I don't really mind, and
I haven't the time, and
I don't...
My only friend, this is the end
Voignamir, Voignamir
Say something for me, Voignamir
Say something to me
Voignamir!
Werewolves, werewolves
Skies will brighten
Brighten, brighten
Brighten
I-I'm on my way of the day
And I know
And I howl
And I prey
I was like the skies
So bright at night
Only 'cause I can't watch the day
As bright at night
All the way
All again
I know, I know
And I'm ready to play
I, I know..
Ah, Mother
I reach for you in the dark
I reach for the dark
Ah, ah
All alone and I can't decide
And I can't decide on him
All alone and I can't seem to
Can't seem to, oh, begin
Holding on (I won't)
And I got my mind (I can't)
And I got my heart (I know)
And I'm in a bind
And I can't decide (I can't)
On him (I know)
I won't, I can't
I know, I'll let you go!
I'll let you go!
I go, and I know, and I wait for you
Hold on, and go on, 'cause I'll wait for you
Faster, faster, the leaves will fall
The sky will grey and my skin will dull
I can't decide on him (I know, I'll let you go!)
And I can't (I can't)
Seem to, can't seem to, oh, begin
(I know, I let you go!)
Can't seem to begin
(I let you go!)
So, so, so, so, bring it all back
I would start to see that I was scared to see it
(Bring it all home, bring it all home, bring it all home
Oh, oh, I'm a ghost, ghost)
(Oh, oh, I'm a ghost, ghost)
Oh, oh, I'm a ghost, ghost
Everybody thinks that I'm boring
Many people think I've got no clue
And to deal with all the fire here outside?
What to do when all of this is blue?
When you say my name I know you love me
When you touch my heart I know I care
When you look at me and I see your face
And then you see the light from over there
Everyone thinks that I'm boring
Everybody knows that I'm a...
What to do with all the fire here outside?
What to do when everything is blue?
When you touch my heart I know I love you
When you say my name I know you care
If you ever had a 
Can you see the light from over there?
We all haunt in the sky at night
Under a sea of clouds I fight
For the win, my love, as she tumbles
Something fell from the blue-white snow
Bright light grew and string my bow
The wind shall seek with the sailor and me
It's the charming love if I saw one
She's giving up the cross
She'll end her faith in love
And I know the way
I know the way
I can believe in me
And I know the way (I don't know the way)
I know the way (I don't know the way)
I can't believe you're home
Мне нужна газета
Every single heart I've touched
Has swiftly turned to gold
But I don't need that fact to know
From the risk of getting old
Oh, I won't take your breath away
Your lungs are too far from my cold fingers
So you don't have to stay
I won't take your breath away
Even now I guess I'm loving you forever
Silence that is ours and we'll use it tonight
I don't wanna say
I don't wanna do anything about this
Or about you
Every single word I say
Has my passion with
Every man I hope to find
Gets wider in the way
But I won't take your breath away
You have nothing to fear cause we're better than fear
Oh I won't take your breath away
So you have me together
Oh na na na na na na oh
(Even now I guess I'm loving you forever)
(Silence that is ours and we'll use it tonight)
I don't wanna do anything about this or about you
Oh, silly love
When I said go
Weigh me down, oh, love
Yeah, oh
So heavy I fell through the earth
'Cause I fucking love
So heavy I fell through the earth
Through the earth (Babe)
Thinking up stories in my mind to relax, every single night
There are no responsibilities there, everything's alright
Every time I'm down, I dream, I dream of you
It's not worth it, though, forgetting everything I know
I need my old friend sitting next to me
Time is everything, I'm thinking why do you have to be?
Where does my heart go when you die
How did that moment pass me by, oh
How can you look so good and feel the way you do
I never knew
Oh, I never knew, oh
Got me dressin' in my Sunday-best; golden spires of light
Hours pass like they are minutes or less, everything is alright
(Was it worth it, though, leaving everything you know?)
I need my friend is sitting next to me
You were everything, I'll help you, why do you have to be?
Oh, I never knew
Ты где моя любимая?
No, I don't know
Oh, I, I go back alone
And I keep wonder, oh
I go back alone
Do you want it?
You
And I can't live my life now
Without you
And I can't think of all I wanna do
You only hated me
I gave you all of me
And I want to see
I took a dare
I wasn't scared
I put my back into it
I know the past
I took a chance
And I can't waste it all on you
Hold me
Am I still alive? I wanna know, I wanna know
Am I still alive? I wanna know
Oh, I go back alone
And I will leave behind
What do you want?
You've only hated me
And I want you
I wanna know, I wanna know
I am 
Will you be my friend tonight?
What will you do?
What are you going to do?
I am noisy
I am noisy now
I'm almost there, I'm almost
And all the 
I won't break your heart in the dark, in the
I won't break your, I won't break your
I won't break your heart in the dark
On a window, I see a plane
How to know, it's in the sky
Where it flies
On a tower, I see a cloud
How to know that it floats
In the sky
On a sheet, I see a flower
How to know, that it's sewn in the cloud
On the wall, there's skies and water
How to know that it flows
Only in the land
I won't break your, I won't break your (Heart, in the dark, in the)

Let, let it boy

Hold on to your heart, yeah

Eyes on, I'm going this way
You know, you know the way
Do you know the way?

Help me
I wait all day
You stay and I can play
Right now or someday
We'll run
Oh, we know
We'll run, we know
Hi, hi, bitter heart and you look at me
And no one can ask you what you think
Hi, hi, bitter heart, you look asleep
Feeling no emotion
Step into the ocean
Now my mind is everywhere
And drowning is the only thought I have
Walk into the water
Boiling as it's hotter
I was looking everywhere
'Cause every time you look away
I think I love you more each day
('Cause every time you look away
I think I love you more each day)
I see blinding light and I know
I, boy, I and I know
And I need, can I please, can I know, I plead
Oh, feel full, full, feel full
When I'm with you, you
Oh-I, I-oh know, know, know, know
I know
B-b-b-b-bye, bye
When and when boy, walk again
Walk again with me
He die, die, die, die, die
On the day, he really, really
About to die
On the day he died
And he'd really think about the why, why, why
He forgot to talk about the why, bye, bye
I 
I am free
My father  me
Hold back my arm
I can  above the way
A clue, a clue, a clue, a clue clue clue
(I did it)
Oh, I'm not shy but I refuse to speak
Because I don't trust you to understand me
But this is the song I wrote you in the dark (Ooh)
Paradise on my right, h-h-hell on my left
I know that you may know
On their sorrow
I know that you'll never know
Favriel
I wanna say
Let it go now
Oh, let it go
Oh, Favriel
Let it go
Oh, will I...
Oh, I know
Wake up now, wake up now
Ah, ah, ah, ah...
Baby, you know when the lights go down
Won't you say please, mama, need me
Leaving the grass and the trees behind
The trees are gone and I wanted to die
I wanna blind my mind in a black hole
I wanna bury my eyes with the sunshine
I wanna know what the stars are talking about tonight
I wanna know where the angels are sleeping
I wanna know if there's something worth keeping
I can't tell you
That one was okay
I be about it, I've been about it
I love my hood, I spring the shot
And I throw it up, I rep the crown
And you saw my cap, it's in my blazes on
Everywhere, I beat my cases
Across the board, golden laces
I'm mortified, into the races
My bitch is fluent, she speak my language
Hop the flight while my killers hanging
We pistol grip 'em, we really banging
I ain't with this shit, I don't really claim it
Record settin', this is really anxious
So I clip this shit if you perpetratin'
T-Y clique they ain't never playin'
We pistol poppin', you pistol playin'
I'm done with talking, killer what you saying
Pulling down
I'm pulling down
I'm pulling down my socks
Polo on my top
Polo on my socks
I fuck around for rent, a mansion or a shop
I hold 'em down for my block
Hope  drop in that pot
I cook it 'til it's a rock
You slip and you could get popped
Lil L turn yourself in
Be one of my killers still lock
The dumb times too high
My home best 
The game had been called up
I wanna leave it behind
I'm pullin' down on my socks
Four X's all in my Sprite
My sprite, my sprite, my sprite, my sprite
My sprite, my sprite, my sprite
(Pulling down
I'm pulling down my socks)
We are real
Up 
I go  in the night, night
I go 
Hey, little girl
Why don't you fall?
Right out of the sky?
Silence goes away
And I would pray
And I would play
And I would go
To see you every time
You were the only one
Pale, we're so numb, ooh
And even though I'm breaking at least
I feel something (Just like release)
Oh, they say
This is what I am
And when, when you
You could chase me down the way
Ah-la, la
Pale, we're so dumb, ooh, ooh
True, as they say
And then, then you
'Cause I know you
But there you are, hidden away
Can't quit fighting with you
You go  abysmal
My, my, want to, want to, want to
Is it real?
, woah
 there is no emotion, woah
I'm speaking like a lord of 
I know a god
The lord of rage
We never care
But boy, it's true
Another tide
By the way, I  for you
And 
In, in the night 
I see inside myself and I know when I go
Little bird flying in the night, if only I, fly
Oh, fantasy
I fell in your arms, take my hands until I'm filled
We fell apart
(Fell apart)
Oh no, baby we fall, fall deep then climb
Until we feel, until the sky
Nightfall
My home
Oh, my fantasy
Take your heart and go to fantasy
Oh, in my fantasy
Oh, no, oh fantasy
Oh, oh, in my own
I left
Da, da, da-da, da-da, da
I wonder, I wonder, I know
Oh, where, oh, where will you go
Oh, where, oh, where you are
I wonder, I wonder, I- 
When you say my name
Time 
For I place  that I am saying I
Can't see 
Ah, cause time 
To bring 
So it plays, I am a 
I am the one I love
Flowing to the sun, fucking heroin
Lately I just turn 'em into reasons, but it refuses
Always down, I'm not up
Guess it's just my rotten luck
To fill my time with permanent gloom
But I can't see above it
Guess I fucking love it
 in a song (Woo!)
Funny how they think, us not even on the brink
Lately, all the ghosts turned into reasons and excuses
 in a song
i dont want my words to be taken out of context
i dont want to be infantilized because i refuse to be sexualized
i dont want to be molested at shows or on the street by people who perceive me as an object that exists for their personal satisfaction
i dont want to live in a world where im gonna have to start employing body guards because this kind of behavior is so commonplace and accepted and I’m pissed that when I express concern over my own safety it’s often ignored until people see firsthand what happens and then they apologize for not taking me seriously after the fact…
I’m tired of men who aren’t professional or even accomplished musicians continually offering to ‘help me out’ (without being asked), as if i did this by accident and i’m gonna flounder without them. or as if the fact that I’m a woman makes me incapable of using technology. I have never seen this kind of thing happen to any of my male peers
I’m tired of the weird insistence that i need a band or i need to work with outside producers (and I’m eternally grateful to the people who don’t do this)
im tired of being considered vapid for liking pop music or caring about fashion as if these things inherently lack substance or as if the things i enjoy somehow make me a lesser person
im tired of being congratulated for being thin because i can more easily fit into sample sizes from the runway
im tired of people i love betraying me so they can get credit or money
I’m sad that it’s uncool or offensive to talk about environmental or human rights issues
I’m tired of creeps on message boards discussing whether or not they’d “fuck” me
I’m tired of people harassing my dancers and treating them like they aren’t human beings
I’m sad that my desire to be treated as an equal and as a human being is interpreted as hatred of men, rather than a request to be included and respected (I have four brothers and many male best friends and a dad and i promise i do not hate men at all, nor do i believe that all men are sexist or that all men behave in the ways described above)
im tired of being referred to as ‘cute,’ as a ‘waif’ etc., even when the author, fan, friend, family member etc. is being positive
(fyi)
waif |wāf|
noun
1 a homeless and helpless person, esp. a neglected or abandoned child: she is foster-mother to various waifs and strays .
• an abandoned pet animal.
cute |kyo͞ot|
adjective
1 attractive in a pretty or endearing way: a cute kitten.
• informal sexually attractive.
I’m tired of people assuming that just because something happens regularly it’s ok
——————————————————
i have so much love for everyone who has been cool and amazing. I have the best job in the world but I’m done with being passive about any kind of status quo that allows anyone to suffer or to be disrespected
Grimes world tour is officially over, the 
visions album
 cycle is officially over, and I’m now taking the time to overhaul everything and make it better
much love to every fan - stuff can be lame sometimes but its really cool to have this support <3

Tie my feet to rocks and drown
None
I fly on a...
I hold...
I know I fly
In time, I will fly
 in a quiet world
In a 
I, when I...
Oh, night, night
I know walk through the light
See me and I being young
I am no, I am no
You're the saddest song
Never cry on the floor
Be me and I know
Daddy's still at forty-nine and
Bring her back all wealthy
Wash my pieces and I have to see
Where my arms stuck
My mind's stuck
When her arrive I wanna wive
I don't give a fuck I’m insane
losing people to drugs and alcohol is the worst because they destroy any good memories you have of them before forcing you to deal with the empty space they leave behind. also whoever keeps putting the few quotes i said early in my career about drugs back into my wikipedia page is an asshole. I don’t want that to be part of my narrative, and if it has to be I want people to know that i hate hard drugs. All they’ve ever done is kill my friends and cause me to be unproductive. Editing a website that people take seriously and reference all the time so that it looks like i think amphetamines are cool is incredibly irresponsible, people might read that and think its a cool thing to emulate. I hope you know you are doing the world a disservice. I just watched another person I care deeply about basically turn into gollum and my heart is broken.
          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
        
Break my heart
Not me this time
Its not me, its fine
Its not me‚ its fine
Not me this time (Everybody knows now)
Its not me‚ its fine (Everybody knows now)
Not me this time (it seems like everybody knows now)
Its not me‚ its fine (it seems like everybody knows now)
Its not me, its fine (it seems like everybody knows now)
Ooh, Ooh‚ Ooh
I don't want us to go-o
I don't wanna go, i don't wanna be there
I don't want us to go-o
I don't wanna go, i don't wanna be there
You don't wanna go, You don't wanna be there
I never felt so bad
Cause when my kitty goes and claws me
Cause when he stuck his fang into my eye
Con zapatitos de oro
¿cómo juega en las praderas?
Non-Lyrical Vocals
Oh, When i cross the bar of the grapes to the yonder
I don't know what to think
Or how far to wander
Oh, I pour my soul for a break into Scarlet
The heat, the boisterous
When i cross the bar of the grapes to the yonder
When you look at my soul
(?)
Were the break hearts
Break hearts lead us
It seems like the end
When all of my friends are getting up to go
How can the eye be lonely
When it never had the chance to know
Anything besides the little lines that
Make up my neck and throat
If only they knew that it was watching them too
Then they wouldn't have the guts to show
Holidays don’t really exist
In the place where you lay your head
If you think it could be
Only you and me, then i don't know where you are
Adamant to keep your happy eyes,  will keep us in our respected lies
Pushing a different carriage, than the one you started with
But how can you know when the symptoms will show
And you've never been elsewhere so there’s no place to go
Twenty first, third and fifth
Oh Sweet Mary
Tba
When will the state agree to cooperate?
We appreciate power
People like to say that we're insane
Pledge allegiance to the world’s most powerful computer
If you’re not backed up, backed up on a drive
We're all having fun
We're all awake and
Maybe the nighttime will hold me fast
And I'm not going to last
Oh, I'm not going to last
We're all awake and I'm not your island
I'm not your island
I'm not yours
I'm not you, because I'm not ready to be in your arms
Your arms
I'm not the only which way
I'm not the only which way to go, oh, oh
I'm not in the night
I'm just a good girl
I never asked if you would stay up with me
You would
I never asked you
I never told you
Would you stay up with me
I'm never thinking
Why do you cry, I'll cheer up with you
