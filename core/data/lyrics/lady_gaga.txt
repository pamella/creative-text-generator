Yeah (Oh)
Turn the mic up
(Yeah, yeah)
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh (Oh)
I, I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream
So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
What you want with my body
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
Early morning, longer nights (Yeah)
Tom Ford, private flights (Yeah)
Crazy schedule, fast life
I wouldn't trade it in, 'cause it's our life
(But let's slow it down)
I could be the drink in your cup
I could be the green in your blunt, your pusher man
Yeah, I got what you want
You wanna escape (Oh)
All of the crazy shit (Let go)
You're the Marilyn, I'm the president
And I love to hear you sing (Girl)
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Back of the club, taking shots, gettin' naughty
No invitations, it's a private party
Yeah, we taking these haters and we roughin' 'em up
And we layin’ the cut like we don't give a fuck
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind (My mind)
But do what you want with my body (Yeah)
Do what you want with my body (With your body)
Do what you want with my body (Body)
Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body and don't stop the party
You can't have my heart and (Help me now)
You won't use my mind
You can’t stop my voice, 'cause
You don't own my life (You)
(What I want, when I want, when I want)
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, world
Help me now
Want you want with my body, world
That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe, I wanna catch on fire
It’s buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn’t find
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die
Oh yeah
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo hoo hooooooooo
When the sun goes down and the band won't play
Way yeah
When you look at me and the whole world fades
Oooh, oooh, hmmmm
(Last night)
Our lovers' quarrel
(I was thinking about you)
Hurts more than I can say
(And it was kind of dirty)
All night
(And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here
(It was kind of nasty, aah!)
(It was kind of trashy)
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there!
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Making love in my sex dreams
We could be caught
(I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought
('Cause I'm broken)
Let's white
(By the one before)
Glove the bed
(He was kind of nasty)
(And I feel so trashy)
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads!
Heard that we both got nothing to do (Woo)
Don't stop the party (Making love in my sex dreams)
Let's keep it naughty, yeah (Making love in my sex dreams)
Watch me act a fool (Making love in my sex dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you, tomorrow when I run into you
You could turn to stone
Or the color of men petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks and...
Oh my God!
Don't stop the party (Damn, you were in my sex dreams)
Let's keep it naughty, yeah (Doing really nasty things)
Watch me act a fool (Damn, you were in my sex dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you (Making love in my sex dreams)
We were in the swimming pool
I was naked, boy, so were you
And we bumped this song while we made love
Dangerous poetry rhymed with our bodies
And now it's time for the trial with doubts and drawls
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, ehh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one
When I bow down to pray
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Caught in a bad romance

I want your love, love, love, love
I want your love, huh, bad!
I want your drama, the touch of your hand (Hey!)
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand
I want your love (Love, love, love, I want your love)
You know that I want you
And you know that I need you
I want it bad
Your bad romance
I want your love, and I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I want your love, and all your lover's revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
Roma-roma-ma
I want your horror, I want your design
‘Cause you’re a criminal as long as you’re mine
I want your love, huh
I want your psycho, your vertigo shtick (Shtick, hey!)
Want you in my rear window, baby, you're sick
And you know that I need you ('Cause I'm a free bitch, baby)
Walk, walk, fashion, baby
Work it, move that bitch crazy
Walk, walk, passion, baby
Work it, I'm a free bitch, baby
I want your love, I don't wanna be friends
Je veux ton amour et je veux ta revanche
Je veux ton amour, I don't wanna be friends (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(I want you back) No, I don't wanna be friends
(Caught in a bad romance) I don't wanna be friends
(Caught in a bad romance) Want your bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Want your bad romance)
Caught in a bad romance (Want your bad romance)
Mum mum mum mah
I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please
Fold 'em, 
let 'em hit me, raise it; baby, stay with me (I love it)
Love game intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

Po-po-po-poker face, fu-fu-fuck her face
(Mum mum mum mah)
I wanna roll with him, a hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me (I love it)
Russian roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby, when it's love, if it's not rough, it isn't fun (fun)
I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lying, I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunnin'
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvelous

Turnin' up emotional faders
Keep repeating self-hating phrases
I have heard enough of these voices
Almost like I have no choice
This is biological stasis
My mood's shifting to manic places
Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships
Watch life, here I go again
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (Ooh)
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, this is the end (Ooh)
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me ever since day one

Keep my dolls inside diamond boxes
Save 'em 'til I know I'm gon' drop this
Front I've built around my oasis
Paradise is in my hands
Holdin' on so tight to this status
It's not real, but I'll try to grab it
Keep myself in beautiful places
Can't see me cry ever again (Ooh)
Pop, pop another one (Ooh)
Pop a 911, then pop another one (Ooh)
Please patch the line, please patch the line
Need a 911, can you patch the line?
I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, “Is it right or is it wrong?”
If only fame had an IV, baby, could I bear
Being away from you? I found the vein, put it in here
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause
Give me that thing that I love (
I'll turn the lights on

Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
I've overheard your theory “Nostalgia's for geeks”
I guess sir, if you say so, some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me

Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby
My mama told me when I was young
"We are all born superstars"
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause he made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby

Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
Yeah, at least now I know
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
You were a perfect illusion
I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touchin' me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm wakin' up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know
Where are you?
'Cause I can't see you
It was a perfect illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy
Illusion
Mistaken for love
Where were you

Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play (Play)
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kind of busy
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)

Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone (No)
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Boy, the way you blowing up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster, leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home 'cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer
It's not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central S-Station (Station)
Tonight I'm not taking no calls 'cause I'll be dancing

Aura-a-a-a, aura-a-a-a
Aura-a-a-a
I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You ought to pity me 'cause was arranged one man to love
But in the bedroom, the size of him's more than enough
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the aura, behind the aura?
Enigma popstar is fun, she wear burqa for fashion
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil?
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech
Behind the aura, behind the curtain, behind the burqa
ART-POP
Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
"'Cause I'm a wandering man," he said to me
"And what about the future plans?
Does this thing we have even makes sense?
When I got the whole world in front of me?"
So, I said...
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
And then he asked me, he said
"Baby, why do we love each other?"
I said, "Honey, it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother."
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life (If you go with me)
For life (See the world with me)
Russia, UK, Paris
I'm Italian, Asian kompai
Africa, India, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
I'm Latin-American
I don't speak German, but I try
Someday in Jakarta
I'm American, I'm gypsy
I'm Bangkok, Australian, Malaysia
Sweden, Finland, Norway
Be my home just for the day
I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
Hey...
We only have the weekend
You can serve it to me, ancient-city style
We can party like it's B.C
.
With a pretty sixteenth-century smile
It's the thing that you bring
That you bring, that you bring
Him, you and me
That's gossip
Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it, ancient-city style
Talk it out, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
That's gossip, what you on?
Money don't talk, rip that song
Gossip, babble on
Ba-Ba-Babylon
Gossip, gossip
Ba-Ba-Babylon (Battle for your life)
Bodies moving like a sculpture (Ooh)
On the top of Tower of Babel tonight
We are climbing up to Heaven (Heaven)
Speak in languages in a BloodPop® moonlight
It's the thing that you bring
Him, you, and me
That's gossip (That's gossip)
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland
Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah (Ah)
Set me free (Ah-ah-ah)
Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah (Ah)
Could you pull me out of this alive?
(Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah)
Where's my body? I'm stuck in my mind
(Oh ma-ma-ma, oh ma-ma-ma)
I'm tired of screaming
(Oh-ma-ma-ma, oh-ma-ma-ma)
At the top of my lungs
(Oh my mother, oh my mother)
I'm in the hole, I'm falling down, down
So down, down
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Sick and tired of waking up
Screaming at the top of my lungs
Think I might've just left myself behind
Maestro, play me your symphony
I will listen to anything
Take me on a trip, DJ, free my mind
Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah, oh (Ah)
I know that we are young, and I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro...
She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you
You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Stop, please, just let me go
Alejandro, just let me go
She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like her dad
And all those flames that burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad
Don't bother me, don't bother me
Alejandro
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Bye, Fernando
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Fernando

(Don't call my name, don't call my name) Alejandro, Alejandro
(I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe) Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro (Fernando)
(Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch) Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro (Just smoke my cigarette and hush)
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro (Roberto)
We are the crowd, we're c-coming out
Got my flash on, it's true, need that picture of you
It's so magical
We'd be so fantastical
Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means, but this photo of us
It don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights, 
'cause you know that, baby, I...
I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars, yeah, 'cause you're my rock star
In between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes
Shadow is burnt,
yellow dance and we turn
My lashes are dry, purple teardrops, I cry
Loving you is cherry pie,
Real good, we dance in the studio
Snap, snap to that shit on the radio
Don't stop for anyone
We're plastic, but we still have fun!
You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this cryin', nobody's gonna
Heal me if I don't open the door
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)
Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Look at me now
'Cause all I ever wanted was love
Hey yeah, hey yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Hey yeah, hey yeah
All I ever wanted was love
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah (Hey yeah, hey yeah)
I want your stupid love, love
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now, it's time to free me from the shame
I gotta find that peace, is it too late or
Could this love protect me from the pain?
I would battle for you (Even if we break in two)
I don't need a reason (Oh)
Not sorry, I want your stupid love
I want your stupid love, love (Oh, oh, woo)
We got a stupid love, love (Love, love, oh)
It's like, I just love a cowboy
You know
I'm just like, I just, I know, it's bad
But I'm just like
Can I just like, hang off the back of your horse
And can you go a little faster?!
3 am, mustang speedin'
Two lovers, headed for a dead end
Too fast, hold tight, he laughs
Runnin' through the red lights
Hollerin' over, rubber spinnin'
Big swig, toss another beer can
Too lit, tonight, prayin'
On the moonlight
Every John is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne
(dat - doo - deet - doe)
(dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)
Baby let's get high, John Wayne
Blue collar and a red-state treasure
Love junkie on a three-day bender
His grip, so hard, eyes glare
Trouble like a mug shot
Charged up, 'cause the man's on a mission
1-2 ya, the gears are shiftin'
He called, I cried, we broke
Racin' through the moonlight
So here I go
To the eye
Of the storm
Just to feel your love
Knock me over
Here I go
Into our love storm
(I'll remember that, I'll remember that)
(I'll remember that, that I)
(I'll remember that, that I)
I walk the downtown, hear my sound
No one knows me yet, not right now
But I am bound to set this feeling in motion
I walk the downtown, hear my sound
I say that I want it, want it (Be free)
Don't fight it, fight it
But if I'm gonna go for it
I'll remember that, that
I'll remember that, that I
I'm not nothing without a steady hand
I'm not nothing unless I know I can
I'm still something if I don't got a man
I'm a free woman, oh-oh (Be free)
(Be free)
This is my dancefloor I fought for
A heart, that's what I'm livin' for
So light up my body and kiss me too hardly
We own the downtown, hear our sound
I'm not nothing without a steady hand (I'm a free woman)
I'm not nothing unless I know I can (I'm a free woman)
I'm a free woman, oh-oh (Be free; c'mon, woo)
I'm a free woman
I'm a free woman (Be free)
Oh yeah (I'm a free woman)
I'm a free woman (Oh), oh-oh (Be free)
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
I’m in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga
When he calls to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
I'll bring him down
Bring him down, down
A king with no crown
King with no crown
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his crooked ways
I've learned love is like a brick
You can build a house or sink a dead body
Ew...
In the most Biblical sense, 
I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute, wench vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense, I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me, if offensed,
or wear ear condom next time
I wanna love you
But something’s pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue and
Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to
(Truth!)
RedOne
Konvict
Gaga (Oh-oh, eh)
I've had a little bit too much, much (Oh, oh, oh-oh)
All of the people start to rush (Start to rush by)
A dizzy twister dance
Can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys?
I lost my phone, phone (Oh, oh, oh-oh)
What's going on on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool
What's the name of this club?
I can't remember, but it's alright, alright
Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Spin that record, babe
Da-da-da-dance, dance, dance
Just j-j-just dance
Wish I could shut my playboy mouth (Oh, oh, oh-oh)
How'd I turn my shirt inside out? (Inside out, right)
Control your poison, babe
Roses have thorns, they say
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight (Oh, oh, oh-oh)
When I come through on the dance floor, checking out that catalogue
Can't believe my eyes
So many women without a flaw
And I ain't gonna give it up
Steady, tryna pick it up, like a call
I'mma hit it, I'mma beat it and latch onto it until tomorrow, yeah
Shorty, I can see that you got so much energy
The way you twirling up them hips 'round and 'round
And there is no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime, stay and let me watch you break it down
And dance
Gonna be okay (Oh-oh)
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance (Ooh, yeah)
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance (Oh)
Da-da-da-dance, dance, dance (Gonna be okay, yeah)
Just j-j-just dance (Oh)
(Incredible... amazing... music)
Wooo!
Let's go!
Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic, got my blueprint, it's symphonic
Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic, got my blueprint, electronic
Go!
Use your muscle, carve it out, work it, hustle
(I got it, just stay close enough to get it on)
Don't slow!
Drive it, clean it, Lysol, bleed it
Spend the last dough (I got it) in your pock-o (I got it)
Life is so simple
A little boy, a little girl
Laughing and loving
Tryin' to figure out the world
It felt like summer when I kissed you in the rain
And I know your story but tell me again
Nothing you say wouldn't interest me
All of your words are like poems to me
I would be honored if you would take me as I am
I want you
To look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me
To be by my side
At the end of my life
Wanna see your face
When I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
I hope you’re still with me
When I’m not quite myself
And I pray that you’ll lift me
When you know I need help
It’s a warm celebration of all of our years
I dream of our story of our fairytale
Family dinners and family trees
Teachin' the kids to say thank you and please
Knowing if we stay together that things will be right
Am I, am I, am I
Am I still alive? Where am I? I cry
Who was it that pulled the trigger, was it you or I?
I'm completely numb, why you acting dumb?
I won't blame myself 'cause we both know you were the one
I don't know what to do, you don't know what to say
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay
The monster inside you is torturing me
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh
Replay, r-replay, eh-eh
Every single day, yeah, I dig a grave
Then I sit inside it, wondering if I'll behave
It's a game I play, and I hate to say
You're the worst thing and the best thing that's happened to me
Psychologically, it's something that I can't explain
Scratch my nails into the dirt to pull me out okay
Does it matter, does it matter? Damage is done
Does it matter, does it matter? You had the gun
You had the gun
Your monsters torture me
Lady of the Dam
Won't be a slave to the blonde, or the culture of the popular
She won't, she won't
Sing at you, I'll fly under radar tonight
Make deals with every devil in sight
I will, I will
'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers, and cheap gin
I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane in Holland tonight
Mary! Jane! Holland!
Woo-hoo!
Oh-hoo!
I don't like to boast
But our truffles are the most
Mad-magical in Amsterdam
So if you have fear, Apollo
Sit on my lyre, and play him like a piano, man
I know that Mom and Dad think I'm a mess
But it's alright, because I am rich as piss
When I ignite the flame and put you in my mouth
The grass eats up my insides, and my brunette starts to sprout
Introducing, ladies and gentleman, Mary Jane Holland!
Cork's off, it's on
The party's just begun
I promise this drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
Because I lost my only friend
God, forgive my sins
Don't leave me, I
Oh, I'll hate myself until I die
My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Stay with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep on searching for an answer, 'cause I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Toast, one last puff and two last regrets
Three spirits and 12 lonely steps
Up heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of a soul
Each day, I cry
Oh, I feel so low from living high
I need you more
Need you more
I don't speak German, but I can if you like, 
ow
Ich schleiban austa be clair, es kumpent madre monstère
Aus-be aus-can-be flaugen, begun be üske but-bair
Ich schleiban austa be clair, es kumpent üste monstère
Aus-be aus-can-be flaugen, fräulein uske-be clair
I'll take you out tonight, say whatever you like
Scheiße, scheiße be mine, scheiße be mine
Put on a show tonight, do whatever you like
Scheiße, scheiße be mine, scheiße be mine (Scheiße be mine)
When I'm on a mission
I rebuke my condition
If you're a strong female
You don't need permission
I
) I wish that I could dance on a single prayer
) I wish I could be strong without somebody there
) I wish I could be strong without the scheiße, yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
) Without the scheiße, yeah
I don't speak German, but I wish I could, ow!
Love is objectified by what men say is right
Scheiße, scheiße be mine, bullshit be mine
Blonde high-heeled feminists, enlisting femmes for this
Express your womankind, fight for your right (Fight for your right)
(Ah, ah) When I'm on a mission
(Ah, ah) I rebuke my condition
(Ah, ah) If you're a strong female
(Ah, ah) You don't need permission
(Ah, ah) I-I-I-I
(Ah, ah) I-I-I-I don't speak German
(Ah, ah) I-I-I-I-I
(Ah, ah) But I can if you like
) I wish I could be strong without permission, yeah
Feelin' something that I can't explain (Oh)
Think it's a wound I still entertain (Oh)
I'd do anything to numb the flame (Oh)
I guess I'm just on fire these days (Oh)
I can't see straight, I can't see me
There's too much hurt caught in between
Wish I could be what I know I am
This moment's hijacked my plans
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you (
Ooh, ooh
I stare at the girl in the mirror, she talks to me too
Yeah, I can see it in your face
You don't think I've pulled my weight
Maybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you
I'm not havin' fun tonight
You love the paparazzi, love the fame
Even though you know it causes me pain
I feel like I'm in a prison hell
Stick my hands through the steel bars and yell
What happens now? I'm not okay
And if I scream, you walk away
When I'm sad, you just wanna play
I've had enough, why do I stay?
Oh, oh, oh
Come to me
In all your glamour and cruelty
Just do that thing that you do
And I'll undress you
Keep it tight
Sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose
Can rescue you
A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)
With all your subtext and fantasy
In a perverse hue
Lovers' kites
Are flown on beaches for public sight
The color palette you choose
Could profit you
Could try to sell you out or I
Could show you all the reasons why
Brushes of darkness won't help you create Your destiny of self
But ARTPOP could mean anything
Anything
I try to sell myself, but I am really laughing
Because I just love the music, not the bling
Music, not the bling
Free my mind
ARTPOP
You make my
Heart stop
Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven's not
Ready for you
Every part
Of my aching heart
Needs you more
Than the angels do
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?
If you could
I know that you'd stay
We both know
Things don't work that way
I promised I
Wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin
And my voice gets thin
Honestly, I know where you're goin'
And baby, you're just movin' on
And I'll still love you even if I can't
See you anymore
Can't wait to see you soar
It’s been a long time since I came around
Been a long time, but I’m back in town
This time I’m not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
He said, "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"
There’s...
(Something), something about this place
(Something), something, ‘bout lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, there's something about, baby, you and I
It’s been two years since I let you go
I couldn’t listen to a joke or a Rock and Roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me "Heart of Gold"
With a guitar humming and a no clothes
"Sit back down where you belong
(There's something), something about this place
You and I
You, you and I
You, you and I, I
Oh yeah, well, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I
C'mon! Put your drinks up!
We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in Heaven
There's only three men that I'ma serve my whole life
It's my daddy, and Nebraska, and Jesus Christ
There's...
(Something), something, something about the chase
Six whole years
I'm a New York woman born to run you down
Still want my lipstick all over your face
Something, something about
Just knowing when it's right
So put your drinks up, for Nebraska
For Nebraska, Nebraska, I love ya
Baby, I'd rather die
Nebraska, I'd rather die
It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time, but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leaving without you
Hush up
Don't speak, don't wanna hear another
Not another word from you
You're just an animal
trying to act real special
But deep down you're just a shrew
Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Do ya? I know, I know, I know you want me
Swine, swine
Swine! Swine!
Be that hog, sweat it out, you squealer
Let your body jiggle
Slap her skin, he loves to watch your ass go wiggle
It's the thrill of ecstasy
Swine!
Paint your face and
Paint his face and catch the beat
Paint her face and catch the beat
Be a swine just catch the beat
For the weekend
Catch the beat
C-catch the beat
Huh huh
Put some lipstick on
Perfume your neck and slip your high heels on
Rinse and curl your hair
Loosen your hips and get a dress to wear
I'm the one who's been coming 'round
Looking to love in you
You're the medicine, I need to heal
The way you make me feel
I'm gon' be MANiCURED
You wanna be man cured
Ma-ma-ma-MANiCURE
She wanna be man cured
Salon’s enough for her not to feel so insecure
She wanna be take care'n of
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? I’m addicted to the love that you garner
Can you feel it? Looking serial killer, man is a goner
Touch me in the dark
Put your hands all over my body parts
Throw me on the bed
Squeeze, tease me, please me, that's what I said!
'Cause I'm the trick who's been coming 'round
You're the, the medicine
I need to heal the way, the way, the way you make me feel
Salon’s enough for her
Not to feel so insecure
Man cure
Heal me, 'cause I'm addicted to love
Save me, 'cause I'm addicted to love
Open-minded, I'm so blinded
Mystery man, woman phantom
Violet light smears the atmosphere
I'm so scared, but I'm standing here
Is what I am seeing real, or is it just a sign?
Is it all just virtual?
We could be lovers, even just tonight
We could be anything you want
We could be jokers, brought to the daylight
We could break all of our stigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma
Can't stop staring, I'm so naked
Wrapped in shadows, my heart races
Dragon's eyes watch,
goddess breathing
Give me something to believe in
Did you hear what I said? (What?)
Did you hear what I said? (Yeah)
Is it all in my head?
Is it all in my head? (Ooh, yeah)
I'll, I'll be your enigma, even just tonight
I'll, I'll be your enigma, brought to the daylight
I'll, I'll be your enigma, brought to the daylight, daylight
Am I E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I
Am I pl-plastic?
Pl-plastic do-o-o-o-oll
Pl-plastic, technologic
Open me up and cut me loose
I come with a purse and new shoes
Am I your type? Am I your type?
(Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh, ooh, ooh la la)
I've lived in a pink box so long
I am top shelf, they built me strong
Am I your type? Am I your type?
(Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh, ooh, ooh la la)
'Cause I've spent too long
Dancing all alone
Dancing to the same song
I'm no toy for a real boy
(Ooh la la, ooh la la)
If you're a real boy
Don't play with me
It just hurts me
I'm bouncin' off the walls
No, no, no, I'm not your plastic doll
(Your plastic doll)
I've got blonde hair and cherry lips
I'm state of art, I'm microchipped
(Ooh la la, oh la la, ooh, ooh, ooh la la)
No, no, no, I'm not your plastic doll (Ooh la la)
Tell me, who dressed you? Where'd you get that hat?
Why is she cryin'? What's the price tag?
Who's that girl, Malibu Gaga?
Looks so sad, what is this saga? (Oh)
Am I E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I
Pl-plastic? (Plastic)
Pl-plastic, technologic (Plastic)
Am I E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I (I'm not your plastic doll)
Pl-plastic?
Pl-plastic, technologic (Ooh la la)
I need you to listen to me, please believe me
I'm completely lonely, please don't judge me
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall
I need you to listen to me, please don't leave me
I'm not perfect yet, but I'll keep trying
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall
'Cause inside, we are really made the same (Oh)
In life, waiting's just a stupid game (Oh)
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)
I'd do anything for you to really see me
I am human, invisibly bleeding
When your smile is shaking, I'll catch you as you fall
I cry more than I ever say (Oh)
Each time, your love seems to save the day (Oh)
I've been hurting, stuck inside a cage
So hard my heart's been in a rage
If you love me, then just set me free
And if you don't, then baby, leave
Set me free
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves (Flying, flying)
Oh (Flying like a thousand doves)
Flying, flying, flying like a thousand doves
Flying, flying, flying (Doves)
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Hey!
I wanna kiss you
But if I do, then I might miss you, babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play a lovegame, a lovegame
Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame
I'm on a mission
And it involves some heavy touching, yeah
You've indicated your interest
I'm educated in sex, yes
And now I want it bad, want it bad
A lovegame, a lovegame
I can see you staring there from across the block
With a smile on your mouth and your hand on your (
huh
The story of us, it always starts the same
With a boy and a girl and a, (
) and a game
And a game (
A lovegame!
(Let's have some fun, this beat is sick)
(I wanna take a ride on your disco stick)
(Don't think too much, just bust that kick)
1-2-3
I'm alone in my house
I'm out on the town
I'm at the bottom of the bottle
I've been knockin' 'em down
I can't get back up on my feet
See the lights on the street like stars
But look what I found
Look what I found
Another piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground
Under the foggy day
I’m lookin' for a light
And my only friend
Is workin' tonight
I can’t get myself out of bed
Hear these voices in my head like a song
Somebody who loves me
Somebody who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
When I met you I was blown to pieces
Heart all over the floor
Ever since you put me back together
I can’t believe it won’t believe it
Uh
Look what you found!
Yeah baby
Someone who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Whoo!
C'mon!
Look what we found
Heart just layin' on the ground
Yeah, it's about that time, yeah
Time ta take off partna, alright?
Hustle Gang, uh huh, G-D-O-D
Get your doe or die, partna
Yup, leggo
Still Bankhead, shawty, yeah, you know what it is
Pockets full of numbers, rubber bands and bills
Came up from 'round, that standard wheel
Was finna do a deal, 'bout 60 mill
You ain't lived that life, you perpetrating
You wasn't really trapping circling birds of prey
You ain't have to beat no murder case
Man, you probably couldn't get a ho any day
'Round my way can't get murder planned
Ain't no hoop, play dirty, man
Put some through your jersey, man
If your partner want some, we can do it again
Okay, H-U-S-T-L-E G-A-N-G, yeah, wait
Yeah, pull up, pull up, hop out, hop out
All about the dollar, better go ahead, Gaga
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Want your jewels, I want your drugs
I admit that my habit's expensive
And you may find it quite offensive
But I won't die at the hands of another
I'm your mother, sister, father, brother
This family is stupid attractive
And you've surveyed the way we’ve acted
Keep it coming, I'm coming around like your friend now
I think you should shut up and sit down
Everybody want that money, what you want
High as hell, trying to have some fucking fun
You don't need 'em, but the diamonds make it shine
Tried to kick it just can't find the time
It's the middle of the week, this ain't even the weekend
Red carpet event, every time you see pimps
It's good pussy in the passenger seat
My lil' homies hang with me, I be passing 'em freaks
Bitch!
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you want to be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs,  play that hustle
Ain't nothing if it ain't family
DJ White Shadow!
Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like the money can never do it like the club
I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I am influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by giving her money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe with a legacy of taking her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista going in warp speed breaking atoms
Blowing O.G. has got me 
creating antimatter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me now
I got her because she ready to party and then move to the club
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'mma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably a dollar be the business, but I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talking about jewels and drugs

Looking good and feeling fine
Slay, slay
Step into the room like it's a catwalk (Fashion)
Singing to the tune, just to keep them talking (Fashion)
Walk into the light, displayin' diamonds and pearls in my (Fashion)

Looking good and feeling fine (Slay)
Slay, slay, slay, slay
I take it off, I put it on
I feel alive when I transform
But this love's not material
Now take it in and turn me on
Zip me up, it can't be wrong
'Cause your new look's ethereal

Mugler Remix
Ayo, I’m Lady Gaga
You know I’m Lady Gaga
Laser cut up, ladder mesh
Mugler show, I’m Lady Gaga
Bad bitches gonna walk the runway
Walk bitches, like Lady Gaga
Ortenberg, you can suck my dick
Walk bitch, you ain't Lady Gaga
Nicopanda got style, trick
Cathy Horyn, your style ain't dick
Walk a mile in these foot high heels
I run in these, you ain't running shit
You chew beef, I wear meat and stay on top
I’m gettin’ fat and so is my bank
I’m on a sold﻿ out world tour bitch
Young, wild, American
Lookin' to be somethin'
Out of school go-go'n
For a hundred or two
Some asshole broke me in
Wrecked all my innocence
I'll just keep go-go'n
And this dance is on you
One, five, ten, lay a million on me
Before the end of this song
C'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?
Rain on me a million
I'm not flawless, but I got a diamond heart
Oh, I
I might not be flawless, but you know
I got a diamond heart
Head full of Jameson
Girl's playin' bad 'cause it doesn't pay to be good
A cruel king made me tough
Daddy's girl's never good enough
'Cause this dance is on you
Good thing I know what I'm worth
Want a good thing, put the money down first
Better get a good look baby
'Cause soon I'm breaking out of here
Diamond heart
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, oh-oh
Ahh
I can't believe what you said to me
Last night we were alone
You threw your hands up
Baby, you gave up
You gave up
I can't believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans
With your long hair and your cigarette stained lies
Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke?
I'll never talk again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless
And I'll never love again
I can't believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
On my bubble dreams
Bubble dreams
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye
And I know that it's complicated
But I'm a loser in love, so baby
Raise a glass to mend all the broken hearts of all my wrecked up friends
You've left me speechless so speechless
I'll never love again
Oh, friend, you've left me speechless
And after all the drinks and bars that we've been to, would you give it all up?
Could I give it all up for you?
And after all the boys and girls that we've been through, would you give it all up?
Could you give it all up, if I promise, boy, to you?
That I'll never talk again
I'll never write a song
Won't even sing along
I'll never love again (Ahh)
So speechless (Ahh)
You left me speechless, so speechless
Will you ever talk again?
Oh, boy, why you so speechless?
Speechless, baby
Some men may follow me
But you choose "death and company"
Why you so speechless?
Hey girl, can you hear me?
Are you holding out your heart?
Hey girl, do you feel me?
Sometimes I go too far
Hey girl, it ain't easy
I know it's pulling me apart
But darlin', don't you leave me
Baby, don't you leave me
Hey girl, hey girl
We can make it easy if we lift each other
We don't need to keep on one-in' up another
If you lose your way
Just know that I got you
Lady is it lonely?
I been callin' out your name
Tell me that you need me
'Cause I need you just the same
Everyday a heartache
I'm just tryin' to keep it sane
But I know you believe me
Baby don't you leave me
Help me hold my hair back
Walk me home 'cause I can't find a cab
And we dance down The Bowery
Held hands like we were 17 again
And then it's 4am
The sun is creepin' up again
Don't you leave me
Oh, darling don't you leave me
Just know that
Here we go!
I can't wait to smoke them all
Whole pack like Marlboro
Blow it in your face
Blow it in your, blow it in your face
I can't wait to rev you up
Faster than you can say "Ferrari"
Tearin' up the gravel
Watch you unravel
Now it's a party
Hey, I can't wait to cast my spell
Which one, you'll never tell
'Cause I got it covered
City gravy southern
Got you drippin' like no other
Get off on me
My body's got you pleadin'
Light me up and breathe in
Mirror on the ceilin'
Off on me
A-YO, A-YO
We smokin' 'em all
I can't wait to blaze for real
Track burns like a road rail
Spin it in your face
Play it in your, play it in your face
Can't wait to get you shook up
Faster than you can try to hate it
You can try to hate it
You can try to fake it
But baby, I laced it
(We smokin' 'em all)
Aaaa-YO
A-YO A-YO
Get it da get it da get it get it
A-YO
Hey YO
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Funk me downtown
I lay around, touch myself to pass the time
I feel down, I wish you were mine
I close my eyes
Take a breath and I picture us in a place
I can't recognize
In the fire I call your name out
(oh-o-oh-oo-ahh-ahh)
Up all night tryin' to rub the pain out
I'm singin'
Baby don't cry
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely
I fool myself
Swirl around as if I'm someone else
Your hands are mine
I do a trick
Pretend that I am you until it clicks
I come alive
Come alive
(call your name out, call your name out)
(oh-o-oh-oo-ahh-ahh) (call your name out)
(oh-o-oh-oo-ahh-ahh) (rub the pain out)
Hurts inside, but not this time
All the things that are on my mind
Vanish as I touch myself
Call out loud for you
Oh, can you hear me singin'?
Money
Oh
Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone
I'll tell them my religion's you
When Pontius comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands above my head
Hands together, forgive him before he's dead, because...
I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
See (see), when you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mary
Love
We are not just art for Michelangelo to carve
He can't rewrite the agro of my furied heart
I'll wait on mountain tops in Paris, cold
J'veux pas mourir toute seule
Gaga, Gaga
Dum dum, da-di-da
Dum dum, da-di-da-dadda-da-di-da
I won't crucify the things you do, do, do
Liberaté mi amor
I'm gonna marry the night
I won’t give up on my life
I'm a warrior queen
Live passionately tonight
I'm gonna marry the dark
Gonna make love to the stark
I'm a soldier to my own emptiness
I'm a winner
I'm not gonna cry anymore
Leave nothing on these streets to explore
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry
I'm gonna lace up my boots
Throw on some leather and cruise
Down the streets that I love
In my fishnet gloves, I'm a sinner
Then I'll go down to the bar
But I won't cry anymore
I'll hold my whiskey up high
Kiss the bartender twice, I'm a loser
Nothing's too cool to take me from you
New York is not just a tan that you never lose
Love is the new denim or black
Skeleton guns are wedding bells in the attic
Get Ginger ready, climb to El Camino front
Won't poke holes in the seat with my heels
Cause that's where we make love
Come on run
Turn the car on and run
I'm gonna burn a hole in the road
I'm gonna marry, marry
Marry
C'mon, c'mon
The night, the night, the night
There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah, baby
But I got a reason that you-hoo should take me home tonight
I need a man that thinks it right when it's so wrong
Right on the limit's where we know we both belong, tonight
It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge with you
Another shot, before we kiss the other side
I'm on the edge of something final we call life, tonight
(Alright! Alright!)
Put on your shades, 'cause I'll be dancing in the flames
It isn't hell if everybody knows my name, tonight
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Don’t call me Gaga
I’ve never seen one like that before
Don’t look at me like that
You amaze me, big boy
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart (You little monster)
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart out (You amaze me)
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart out
Look at him
Look at me
That boy is bad
And honestly, he’s a wolf in disguise
But I can’t stop staring in those evil eyes
I asked my girlfriend if she’d seen you 'round before
She mumbled something while we got down on the floor, baby
"We might’ve fucked, not really sure, don’t quite recall
But something tells me that I’ve seen him, yeah"
That boy is a monster (Mo-mo-mo-monster)
That boy is a monster-er-er-er-er-er
He ate my heart (I love that girl)
He ate my heart (wanna to talk to her, she’s hot as hell)
He licked his lips
Said to me, "Girl, you look good enough to eat."
Put his arms around me
Said, “Boy, no, get your paws right off me.”
He ate my heart, he ate my heart
Instead he’s a monster in my bed
I wanna just dance, but he took me home instead
Uh-oh, there was a monster in my bed
We french kissed on a subway train
He tore my clothes right off
He ate my heart and then he ate my brain
Uh-oh, uh-oh (I love that girl)
Uh oh-oh, oh (Wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell)
(He ate my heart) Uh oh-oh, oh
(He a-a-ate my heart) Uh oh-oh, oh
(Wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell)
That boy, that boy, that boy, that boy...
I confess I am lost
In the age of the social
On our knees, take a test
To be lovin' and grateful
Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
But the people just stood around
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
Doesn't everyone belong
In the arms of the sacred?
Why do we pretend we're wrong?
Has our young courage faded?
Why do people just stand around?
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Save that angel
Catch that angel
(Make it stop!)
Silicone, saline, poison, inject me
Baby, I’m a free bitch
I’m a free bitch
Some girls won’t dance to the beat of the track
She won’t walk away, but she won’t look back
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she’s a mess
She’s a mess, she’s a mess
Now the girl is stressed
She’s a mess, she’s a mess, she’s a mess, she’s a mess
(Tell 'em, girls)
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he’s looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
Run, run, her kiss is a vampire grin
The moon lights her way while she’s howling at him
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she’s a tramp
She’s a tramp, she’s a vamp, but she still does her dance
She’s a tramp, she’s a vamp, but she still kills the dance
In the dark
She loves to dance in the dark
She loves, she loves to dance in the dark
Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia
Tell 'em how you feel, girls
Work your blonde (Jon) Benet Ramsey
We’ll haunt like Liberace
Find your freedom in the music
Find your Jesus, find your Kubrick
You will never fall apart Diana, you’re still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Together, we’ll dance in the dark
Baby
I came down the mountain
Draggin' our love affair
Put on a pretty little number
I'm wearing you still
It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast
Nobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me
He has a funny way sayin' forever too fast
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp
For somethin' he don't have
I get on my knees and beg you
Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Got a baby sister who looks just like me
She wants nothin' more than a man to please
Maybe she's in too deep
Her love for him ain't cheap
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece
From Fulton Street
The man's got a gift for gettin' what he wants
He's thirsty when he drinks
Gets on the brink, and throws her off
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold
I can carry you, but not your ghosts
Wish I had the faith, but I don't know, oh
I was 23
She was 35
I was spiralin' out
And she was so alive
A Texas girl real strong
Taught me this drunk song
So when I start to bawl
She says, "let your teardrops fall"
On the Pinot
Pinot Grigio girls
Pour your heart out
Watch your blues turn gold
All the Pinot
Keep it real cold
'Cause it's a fired up world
Ooh-oh-ooh-oh
Make it all make sense
Does it all make sense?
Sisters never pack up
We always run back, love
Seven years ago
I said you'd make it
Sonja was Joanne's friend
Tough girls on the mend
So when I'm feelin' small
I toss that cork and call
So we'll turn on a bachelorette
Dye Ashley's hair red
And then we'll have our sixth
Spice Girl in this bitch!
Gather 'round now
Why do you look so good in those jeans?
Why'd you come around me with an ass like that?
You're makin' all my thoughts obscene
This is not, not like me
Why you keep on texting me like that? (Damn)
Got other things I need my mind on, yeah
Other responsibilities
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahhh, ahh-ahhh
Boy could you please stop bein' so fine
When I stare at you, I wish I were blind
'Cause I begin to lose control
No I can't, can't let go
'Cause ever since I met you
I've been prayin' on my knees
That you would always stay around
That you would never leave
But I'm the kind of girl that always needs to be free
Why did you do that to me?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh (Oh, why did you do that?)
Why did you do that? (Do that)
I can't stop talkin' 'bout what you do to me
You keep keepin' me from how I'm supposed to be
To be
Do that to me (Oh why did you do that to me?)
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that (Why?)
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh, ahh-ahhh (Why did you do that to me?)
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh, ahh-ahhh (Why did you do that?)
Treat me like your patient
Just don't keep me waiting
Or I'll just be wasted
In a crowd of the lonely
I need you to inspire me
When I can't inspire myself
I need you to provide for me
When I feel like someone else
Lay me down, lay me down now
Lay me down, touch my spirit, oh
Lay me down
Heal me
God knows nothin' else is gonna
Gonna heal me
Oh, before it's too late
Won’t you steal me?
Steal me all the way from myself
Won't you heal me?
Heal me ah-ah
Heal me ahah
Dose me with your energy
Leave your soul inside of me
Cool me down and calm me
Ring me, don't alarm me
Ooh before it's too late
Won’t you steal me
I wanna be more or equal, not less
I wanna be happy with someone
I wanna feel blessed
I wanna be more or equal not less
Won't you steal me
Heal me, ah-ah
Yeah man, play that New York drum, Homer
Show 'em how we do it
Downtown
Just another way to prove
I love you, when it's hard today
I'll lay back in my chair and find a way
And when you say that thing that you say
That makes me mad, I'll turn away
I'll turn away
And think of different ways to keep my spirits up
And choreograph hours with playful, joyish thoughts
We both know I could learn a thing or two
About relaxing, hey I love you
And after all it's just another day
Oh, I could use some two or three
Or other kind of ways to be
But today I won't be so hard on me
I'll walk alone down a different street
And smile at all the new strange I meet
And pick up unique style, I'll kick around today
And create simple thoughts
I'll laugh in humble ways
I could learn a thing or two
About behavin'
But I love you
Come on, Mark!
Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Newman
And after all, it's just another day
Oooooh oooo, oooooh oooo
And after all
It's just another day
Des yeux qui font baisser les miens
Un rire qui se perd sur sa bouche
Voilà le portrait sans retouches
De l'homme auquel j'appartiens
Quand il me prend dans ses bras
Il me parle tout bas
Je vois la vie en rose
Il me dit des mots d'amour
Des mots de tous les jours
Et ça m'fait quelque chose
Il est entré dans mon cœur
Une part de bonheur
Dont je connais la cause
C'est lui pour moi, moi pour lui dans la vie
Il me l'a dit, l'a juré pour la vie
Et dès que je l'aperçois
Alors je sens en moi
Mon cœur qui bat
(Would anybody like some French tips tonight?)
La vie en rose
Would you love me right?
My life is a story
Do you wanna know the truth?
I'm tall in high heels
But I am only five foot two
What you see ain't always
What you gonna get, it's true
You see the best in me
Even when I have no clue
I don't wanna feel this way no more
I don't wanna feel this weight
I'm sick of hiding from myself
I don't wanna feel this pain
I don't wanna run far from my home
I don't wanna lose my way
I don't wanna be my friend no more
I don't wanna play this game
Would you still love me if I gave it all up just to cry?
Would you still love me?
Would, would you still love me right?
Would you still need me if I didn't t-tell you goodbye?
Take my picture from me
And imagine what I'd do
I know what's best for me
Tryna do what's best for you
This could all be fiction
I know that it sounds taboo
I wear my heart on my sleeve
It's making its debut
Would you still love me right?
I met a girl in East LA
In floral shorts as sweet as May
She sang in eights in two Barrio chords
We fell in love
But not in court
La la la la la la la
I don't, I don't...

Man, it wasn't that long ago we were all living in the jungle
So why do we gotta put each other down
When there's more than enough love to g-g-go around?
Come to mama

I love that lavender blonde
The way she moves, the way she walks
I touch myself, can't get enough
And in the silence of the night
Through all the tears and all the lies
I touch myself and it's alright
Just give in
Don't give up baby

I just wanna be myself, and I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself, and I want you to know
I am my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair

And this is my prayer, I swear
I'm as free as my hair

Hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
As free as my hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Sometimes I want some raccoon or red highlights
Just because I want my friends to think I'm dynamite
And on Friday, Rock City High School dance
I've got my bangs to hide that I don't stand a chance
A chance (
No
I just wanna be free, I just wanna be me
And I want lots of friends that invite me to their parties
Don't wanna change, and I don't wanna be ashamed
I'm the spirit of my hair
It's all the glory that I bare
I'm my hair, I am my hair
I am my hair, I am my hair
I am my hair (
Glory that I bare
It’s all the glory that I bare
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah (
All the glory that I bare
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah
Ooh, my hair, my hair
Heavy metal lover
I want your whiskey mouth all over my blonde south
Red wine, cheap perfume, and a filthy pout
Tonight bring all your friends, because a group does it better
Why river with a pair?
Let's have a full house of leather
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Dirty pony, I can't wait to hose you down
You've got to earn your leather in this part of town
Dirty pearls and a patch for all the Rivington Rebels
Let's raise hell in the streets, drink beer and get into trouble
I could be your girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
But would you love me if I ruled the world, world, world?
Whip me, slap me, punk funk
New York clubbers, bump drunk
Bud Lite, liquors, bar slam
Move it, this is your jam
Wash the night with St. Jame-son
Like a baptism, heavy metal lovers play
Baby, we were born this way
[
Chorus
(I could be your girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl)

Hurry up, hurry up (Hurry up)
Woah, woah
Before you lose me too
Hurry up, hurry up

Tell me you love me
Could you please find another way?
I start to think that I'm insane
Tryin' to stay here
Let me just lay here

I'm 'bout to lose it

Say somethin' lovin' to me before I crumble
Tell me
Have I said what I needed to say?
Have you said what you wanted to say?
Did you say what you wanted to say?
Would you try and stop me
Before I cry?

Hey there, sugar baby
Saw you twice at the pop show
You taste just like glitter mixed with rock 'n' roll
I like you a lot, lot
Think you're really hot, hot
Know you think you're special when we dance real crazy
Glam-ophonic, electronic, disco, baby
All we want is hot, hot
Boys, boys, boys (
we like boys in cars
buy us drinks in bars
Boys, boys, boys with hairspray and denim
And boys, boys, boys (
we love them, we love them!
) woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
) no-oh-no-oh-oh-oh-oh
Baby is a bad boy with some retro sneakers
Let's go see The Killers and make out in the bleachers
Let's go to the party, heard our buddy's the DJ
Don't forget my lipstick, I left it in your ashtray
I'm not loose, I like to party
Let's get lost in your Ferrari
Not psychotic or dramatic
I like boys, and that is that
Love it when you call me legs
In the morning, buy me eggs
Watch your heart when we're together
Boys like you love me forever

Boy, we've had a real good time
And I wish you the best on your way, eh-eh
I didn't mean to hurt you
I never thought we'd fall out of place, eh-eh, hey
I have something that I love long, long
But my friends keepa' tellin' me that something’s wrong
Then I met someone
And eh
There's nothing else I can say
I wish he never looked at me that way
Eh-eh, hey-eh-ey
Not that I don't care about you
Just that things got so compliquées, eh-eh
I met somebody cute and funny
Got each other and that's funny, eh, eh-eh, hey
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
Eh-eh, eh-eh, hey, yeah
Eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
Eh-eh, hey-eh-ey (ooh, yeah)
There's nothing else I can say (eh-eh)
Eh-eh (eh-eh), eh-eh (eh-eh)
I wish he never looked at me that way (eh-eh)
Eh-eh, hey
Oh yeah, all I can say is "eh-eh"
When all the world is a hopeless jumble
And the raindrops tumble all around
Heaven opens a magic lane
When all the clouds darken up the skyway
There's a rainbow highway to be found
"The Prelude Pathétique"- First Part:
When I look back on my life it’s not that I don’t want to see things exactly as they happened, it’s just that I prefer to remember them in an artistic way. And truthfully the lie of it all is much more honest because I invented it. Clinical psychology tells us arguably that trauma is the ultimate killer. Memories are not recycled like atoms and particles in quantum physics. They can be lost forever. It’s sort of like my past is an unfinished painting and as the artist of that painting I must fill in all the ugly holes, and make it beautiful again. It’s not that I have been dishonest; it’s just that I loathe reality
For example those nurses, they're wearing next season Calvin Klein and so am I. And the shoes custom Giuseppe Zanotti. I tipped their gause caps to the side like Parisian berets because I think it's romantic, and I also think that mint will be very big in fashion next spring
Check out this nurse on the right; she's got a great ass. Bam
The truth is back at the clinic they only wore those funny hats to keep the blood out of their hair. And that girl on the left she ordered gummy bears and a knife a couple of hours ago, they only gave her the gummy bears. I'd wish they'd only given me the gummy bears
"The Prelude Pathétique"- Last Part:
You may say "I lost everything". But I still had my Be-Dazzler. And I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M&J Trimming. So I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do; I did it all over again
Midnight rush, with a pen in my hand
Inkin' Lincoln, sanskrit with a fan
Rememberin' me, before we began
Sometimes I felt so Def in the Jam
But the ones who loved me, told me to stop
Like, "Homegirl can't catch shit if it drop"
A superwoman chick, you know that I am
Some shit don't fly by me in a man
'Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone who's got the flavor
But don't have no follow through
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want any paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Got something really shiny to start
Want me to sign there on your Range Rover heart
I’ve heard it before
Yeah, the dinners were nice
'Til your diamond words melted into some ice
You shoulda been rappin' to the beat of my song
Mr. Californ-ia, paper ganster-a
I'm lookin' for love, not an empty page
Full of stuff that means nothin' but "you’ve been played"
But have no follow through
Don't want no paper gangsta (gangsta, gangsta)
Don't want no paper gangsta (gangsta, gangsta, gangsta)
We don't care what people say, we know the truth
Enough is enough of this horse shit
I am not a freak, I was born with my free gun
Don't tell me I'm less than my freedom
I'm a bitch
I'm a loser, baby, maybe I should quit
I'm a jerk
Wish I had the money, but I can't find work
I'm a brat
I'm a selfish punk, I really should be smacked
My parents tried
Till they got divorced 'cause I ruined their lives
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
Oh, I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right (Know wrong from right)
I'm a bad kid, and this is my life, one of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right (This is my life)
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure
I'm a twit
Degenerate, young rebel and I'm proud of it
Pump your fist if you would rather mess up than put up with this
I'm a nerd
I chew gum and smoke in your face, I'm absurd
I'm so bad
And I don't give a damn, I love it when you're mad
When you're mad, when you're mad
I'm not that typical baby
I'm a bad kid like my mom and dad made me
I'm not that "cool and you hate me"
I'm a bad kid, that's the way that they made me
I'm a bad kid, I'm disastrous
Give me your money or I'll hold my breath
One of the bad kids don't know wrong from right
A bad kid baby
It's in time with it
In your brown eyes, I walked away
In your brown eyes, I couldn't stay
In your brown eyes, you'll watch her go
Then turn the record on and wonder what went wrong
What went wrong?
If everything was everything, but everything is over
Everything could be everything if only we were older
I guess it's just a silly song about you
And how I lost you and your brown eyes
In your brown eyes, I was feeling low
'
Cause the brown eyes, and you never know
Got some brown eyes, but I saw her face
I knew that it was wrong
So baby, turn the record on
Play that song
Where everything was everything, but everything is over
Brown eyes
Everything was everything, but baby it's the last show
Everything could be everything, but it's time to say goodbye
So get your last fix, and your last hit
Grab your old girl with her new tricks
Honey, yeah, it's no surprise that I got lost in your brown eyes
In your brown eyes
Brown, brown eyes
Your brown eyes
Got some brown eyes
It's off, it's on
Take off, and run
Let's celebrate the fun of being young
I don't wanna grow up
'Cause when the lights come on
You lift me up, and I feel strong
I won't be right without you
And I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone
I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how, we'll get through
I'll keep on singing while I'm living, but I wanna be in love
And I wanna be with you
This one's for you
Lights off, lights on
The music has begun
Rely, or run
Get the bad guy's gun
I love the songs that you play
And I don't care what they say
'Cause I was born this way
And I hear you scream, I hit the top of the stage
And close my eyes, and know exactly who I am
And I won't be right without you
I'll keep on singing for a living, but I wanna be in love
And I, I wanna be with you
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions on a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
My body is sanctuary
My blood is pure
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
You want me bad
I think you're cool, but I'm not sure
Follow me, don't be such a holy fool
Follow me, I need something more from you
It's not about sex or champagne, you holy fool
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel
Confess to me, where you have been
Next to the bar
Pray for your sins right under the glass disco ball
Follow me, I need something sacred from you
Together, we'll both find a way
To make a pure love work in a dirty way
Oh, oh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Meet me, meet me, meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me
(Meet me, meet me)
Oh, if you wanna, meet me at Electric Chapel
Leave the coffin open when I go
Leave my pearls and lipstick on, so everybody knows
Pretty will be the photograph I leave
Laying down on famous knives, so everybody sees
Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Someone I'll know could love and save me from myself
Maybe I'll just clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Di and die with you
I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong
I wish that I could cope
But I took pills and left a note
I'm hungry from an anorexic heart
I've been trying to tell you how I feel, but was never very smart
I'm wrapped in silks made for Egyptian queens
I'll do it in the swimming pool, so everybody sees
I'll need someone to love and save me from myself
Maybe I'll just keep clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
Princess die
I want to see her cry
We want to watch her cry
I wish that I could go in my rich boyfriend's limo
Right after he proposed with a 16-carat stone wrapped in rose gold
With the paparazzi all swarming around
In my Louis Vuitton white buttoned down
Oh, it's not that deep
So bob your head for another dead blonde whose real prince is in heaven
She just wants to sleep
The final act of life will be my own hands to do
I can't help myself
I'm addicted to a life of material
It's some kind of joke
I'm obsessively opposed to the typical
All we care about is runway models, Cadillacs and liquor bottles
Give me something, I wanna be retro glamour
Hollywood, yes, we live for the...
Fame (Fame)
Doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
'Cause we got a taste for champagne and endless fortune
Fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame
We live for the fame, fame, baby
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby?
A shame, shame
In it for the fame, fame, baby
I can see myself in the movies, with my picture in city lights
Photograph my mind
And whatever else you'd like to shoot, you decide
All we care about is pornographic girls on film and body plastic
Give me something
I wanna see television, and hot blondes in odd positions
Don't ask me how or why, but I'm gonna make it happen this time
My teenage dream tonight
Yeah, I'm gonna make it happen this time
Fame, fame
Doin' it for the fame
We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely run, on the road to love
Follow that unicorn on the road to love
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her top down, baby, she flies
Run run, with the fury of a saint in her eyes
Run run, ha-cha cha cha, baby, she goes
With blonde hair and a gun smoking under her toes
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah oh-oh-oo-oh
Ride ride, pony, ride ride
Ride ride, pony, tonight
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love
She's just an American, riding a dream
When she's got a rainbow syrup in her heart that she bleeds
She don't care if your papers or your love is the law
She's a free soul burning roads, with a flag in her bra
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause' we're gonna fall in love tonight
'Cause' we're gonna drink until we die
Groove, slam, work it back
Filter that
Baby, bump that track
Space Cowboy just play that track
Gaga in the room
So starstruck
Cherry-Cherry-CherryCherryBoomBoom
Rollin' up to the club on the weekend
Styling out to the beat that you're freakin'
Fantasize, I'm the track that you're tweakin'
Blow my heart up
Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor
Queue me up
, I'm the 12 on your table
I'm so starstruck
[Chorus: Lady Gaga + 
Space Cowboy
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up
I'm so
) starstruck
I'm so (
starstruck
Baby, now that we're alone, got a request
Would you make me number one on your playlist?
Got your Dre headphones with the left side on
Wanna scratch me back and forth back and forth? uh-huh
Get the breakdown first
Up until the chorus to the verse
Re-ke-re-ke-reverse
Hey, lil mamma, like really, really is that him?
I done seen you before
What you got on them big rims?
Enter that cash flow
I'm like, baby, you don't trip
So shawty, say hand over your signature right here
Like adjust the dotted line, and I'm supposed to sign
How she at it, a fanatic and I think it's goin' down
She so starstruck, the gal all stuck
I shoulda had an overdose, too many Starbucks
Ain't never seen a balla, paper that stack taller
Stunners who let the top back on the Chevy Impala
Hummers and all that, fully loaded with two spoilers
What did you call that when you showed up with two dollars?
But that's another chapter, son of a bachelor
All on me, just spotted a baby actor
Complete swagger, there go the dagger
Got what she wants, shawty happily ever after
Want to scratch me back and forth back and forth, uh-huh
I'm so, I'm so
Starstruck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up, blow my heart up
Initiating Cherry Cherry Boom Boom, Lady Gaga
I like it rough
Your love is nothing I can't fight
Can't sleep with the man who dims my shine
I'm in the bedroom with tissues and when
I know you're outside bangin', then I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life with love in the world
And I'm a hard girl
Loving me's like chewing on pearls
You've got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
Won't go without my fix tonight
It's a little too rough
Prom girl wipes her tears with silver lines
And she can't get enough
I'm in the bedroom with tissues
And when I know you're outside banging, then I won't let you in
Loving me's like straightening curls
You've got me wondering why I (
you got me
), I like it rough
oh, yeah
I'm shiny, and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough (
baby, likes it rough
Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough; baby, likes it rough
Is it cause you don't mean it, or because I don't feel it unless it's rough?
Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough; Lady Gaga
You got, yeah, yeah, you have got me, oh, wondering why
You got me wondering why I, I like it rough
You got me wondering why I (

Black, black, black
Jesus is the new black
Ow!
I grew up in New York City
Since I was born on Broadway, baby
Moved downtown when I was just nineteen
To start a new life on the New York scene
There's no way I could be stopped
Was taking my best shot
I had a better plan
Was coming for your spot
I met a better man
Amen
On the runway, dressed in his best
Amen, fashion
On the runway, work it, Black Jesus
Dancing in my revelation
Underground pop civilization
Concrete poetry to feed my mind
Old symbolism was left behind
Put it on, amen, fashion
Celebrate, ooh-ooh, a new compassion
Celebrate, ooh-ooh, style your passion
Celebrate, ooh-ooh, wear out your vision
Black Jesus, black Jesus, black Jesus
Jesus is the new black, ow

Pornographic dance fight

Our hair is perfect while we're all getting shit wrecked
It's automatic, honey
Daddy, I'm so sorry

We just like to party
Like to p-p-party, yeah
Bang, bang

None
Got no plans, got no clothes
Got no piano, we got no shows
No, I got nothing to do
But to be stuck on you
Got no flights outta here
Got no TV shows until next year
Baby, you’re my liquor
I’m addicted to you
So I’ll just be stuck on, stuck on fucking you
Stuck on fucking you
I don’t ever want just another boy or a girl
Baby, you and I, baby, you and I could change the world
I don’t ever want just another boy or a girl to love
I’m stuck, stuck on you
Got all night, no cameras
We've got no champagne but we've got drugs
No, I've got nothing to do
Purple sheets, cymbal clock
Going to spend my time rocking on top
Yea, I got nothing to do
Baby, you’re my Johnny Walker
Baby, it’s true
Got no plans, got no flights
While we’re here, no TV shows
But we got mice in the kitchens
But we don’t care 'cause we’re in love
Get in the shower
I’ll meet you there
I bought you some hippie shit from the Deli down the stairs
Love it when my man smells so good
Don’t forget me baby
Don’t forget me when I leave and go on tour
'Cause I know your life would be a snore
You’d be all stuck fucking this hooker-whore
This hooker, whore
Got no nothing
You’re in the next room
You fell asleep on my tour bus while me and Fernando and Paul and Justin and Dave are making music
But I miss you
The fridge is broke
And drinking warm champagne
But we don’t care cause we’re in Minnesota
And we’re sold out show again
And it's a sold show again
Okay, just stop here, I could go on forever
Oh, tonight I'm gonna show them what I'm made of, oh
The killer queen inside me's coming to say "hello"
Oh, tonight I will return
The fame and riches earned
With you, I'd watch them all be burned
Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14 karat guns to win
I am a woman, I insist, it's my life
I can be the queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release
And be brave for you, you'll see
I can be, the queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed, it's happening
I can be the queen
I am wind and hurricane, the stormy sky and rain
When you run dry, I'll flood your pain
In between the moments of the lady I've become
A voice speaks through the noise like drums
Rum-pum-pum-pum
The que ee-ee-ee-ee ee-ee-eeen
The queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen
Starry night
Come inside me, like never before
Don't forget me when I come crying to Heaven's door
I will fly
On a challenger across the sky
Like a phoenix, so you can remind them of the dream I bore
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
One, two, three
Nowhere
Yeah, we’re goin' nowhere fast
Maybe this time
I’ll be yours, you’ll be mine
C-c-c-crazy (
crazy
Get your ass in my bed
Baby, you’ll be just my summer boyfriend
Summerboy...
Let’s get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice, we can be alone
Bikini top’s comin' o-o-off
Don’t be sad when the sun goes down
You’ll wake up, and I’m not around
I’ve got to go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’ll still have the summer after all
Sometimes you might start a fight
But I’m happy pretending we're alright
Sunglasses cover up my green eyes
My martini glistens, yeah, while checking out other guys
Bikini top’s coming o-o-off
Hey there, Summerboy
Let’s go for a drive
Take me for a ride
Never gonna close our eyes
I’m a busy girl
Don’t got too much time
Hurry up, before I change my mind
I’m taking off my heels
Let’s go for a run
Have a little summer fu-u-un
Bikini top’s poppin' o-o-off
You've got to go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’ll still have the summer after...
Somewhere nice we can be alone
I have got my, summer-summerboy
You’ll wake up and I’m not around
And we’ll still have the summer after all
I've got my-
Yes, I've got my-
I've got my summer-summer boy
I never was the kind of girl that's
Naturally sure when it comes to love, oh no
I was insecure
Insecure
But when it comes to you and me
I can't deny this feeling inside, oh no
I never felt like this before
This before, no, no, no
) I'm seeing all the signs from above
) I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah
) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
) 'Cause baby, I was born to be his
You know that I'd never cheat on a man
'Cause I'm not like that
I'm physically crafted to be as fitting as McQueen
But when it comes to clothing, I'm bad
I'm fashionably just designed to grand
Oh, and he's no accessory to me
-Ry to me, no, no, no!
No, I just can't seem to forget you
No, I can't for just as long as I met you
You're my babe right through
I was made for you
They say I need a strong man, not just a friend
But baby, my search is done
No longer reason to cry or to justify
How I feel for you, my love
I'm seeing all the signs from above
I'm gonna be the one that he loves
That's M-O-N-E-why so sexy? I...
Damn, I love the Jag, the jet, and the mansion (oh, yeah)
And I enjoy the gifts and trips to the islands (oh, yeah)
It's good to live expensive, you know it
But my knees get weak
Intensive...
When you give me k-kisses (that's money, honey)
When I'm your lover and your mistress (that's money, honey)
When you touch me, it's so delicious (that's money, honey)
Baby, when you tear me to pieces (that's money, honey)
Damn, I'd love a boat by the beach on the West Coast (oh, yeah)
And I'd enjoy some fine champagne while my girls toast (oh, yeah)
You know I 'preciate the finer things
But it's not what makes me happiest, baby
(I can do without it, babe)
Your tender loving's more than I can handle
Never burn out this candle baby, baby
K-k-k-k-kisses (that's money, honey)
ArtRAVE
Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up
Hi, I want to come and make peace with you
But they won't let me
No, they won't let me through
I don't mind if they a-arrest me
'Cause I'm wearing my Versace
Why can't we just put on a smile and a buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz?
We all might be sick
Whether it's at first or after a few drinks
We're gonna unite, don't think
Prepare, I descend from the East
I'm from Jakarta-a-a
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the West
My name is Lady Gaga
Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby smoke it up 'til we're high
(Now Jump)
In a way, exhausting
We're problem solving
Drink 'til she's attractive
Talking 'bout diplomatic
I brought my plastic
Making that peace attractive
I always thought it was you
You always thought it was me
We always thought we were it
Seemed like a real perfect fit
Those Brooklyn nights set us free
I always thought even though
We were so young, we could grow
Up in the end, it'd be us
We'd take the F by the bus
Where Brooklyn nights set us free
It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy
I missed our cheap chandelier
'Member when dad hung it there?
And we would watch Rocky IV
The one where the Russians scored?
I love Briggite Nielsen's hair
I'd call you my champion
Thought we had already won
And cracked open the last beer
Falling asleep in our tears
I found an old pair of keys in my purse
That opened the walk up we shared
How did they get there, jerk?
I wanna see you there, I wanna make it work
I didn't brush my hair and my lashes are falling off
Of seven years of our bad luck dating
I want our last night there, a Brooklyn night affair
A Brooklyn night affair
It's not that I don't wanna love you 'cause I really tried and I
Just wanna hang with the old you
For just one Brooklyn night, adieu
Have a drink with your former self
We both won't act like someone else
Maybe then we'll both tell the truth
In the arms of the sacred
Shots were fired down the street
I am, I'm too fabulous
I'm so fierce that it's so nuts
I live to be model thin
Dress me, I'm your mannequin
J'adore, 
Vivienne
habillez-moi
Gucci, Fendi et Prada
Valentino, Armani too
Merde
, I love them Jimmy Choo
Fashion, put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me?
I am anyone you want me to be
Ooh, la la la
We love designer
I need some new stilettos
Can't walk down the street in those
You are who you wear, it's true
A girl's just as hot as the shoes she choose
Weitzman
, habillez-moi
Louis
, Dolce Gabbana
Alexander McQueen, eh-oh
Merde, I love those 
Manolo
Ra-pa-pum-pum
Light me up, put me on top
Let's fa la la la la, la la la la
The only place you'll want to be
Is underneath my Christmas tree
The only place you want to be
Ho ho ho (ra-pa-pum-pum)
Under the mistletoe (ra-pa-pum-pum)
Yes, everybody knows (ra-pa-pum-pum)
We will take off our clothes (ra-pa-pum-pum)
Yes, if you want us to, we will
You...
Oh-oh, a Christmas
My Christmas tree's delicious
Light you up, put you on top
Let's fa la la la la, la la la la (let's go!)
Yes, if you want us to we will
Here, here, here (ra-pa-pum-pum)
The best time of the year (ra-pa-pum-pum)
Take off my stockings where?
I'm spreading Christmas cheer
Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga
And she goes
Here we go
Cherry Cherry Boom Boom
Oh, disco heaven
Get back, bunny
It's getting cold in here, little honey
We've got a show to put on your dress
Take a minute for us and relax, relax
Cupid's got me, oh, with his bow and arrow, baby
He'll hit you in the pants, hot pants
Get the people to dance and relax, relax
Oh, the lights dim while we're dancin'
Yeah, the floor is shakin' in this disco heaven (oh, disco heaven)
D-disco heaven (oh, disco heaven)
Throw your head back, girly
Throw it like those girls in the movies
The ball is turning
A 300 mirror's burning through the hearts of the crowd
In the back hips just banging the track to the muzak, muzak
Oh, we got that disco, D-I-S-C-O
And we're in heaven, H-E-A-V-E-N
Disco heaven
Feels just like heaven
A line up for the dance
Yeah, bring those fancy pants
You know there's disco in the air, and hairspray everywhere
A disco heaven
You gotta a lot, a lot of nerve
Comin' here when I'm still with him
And I can't have you
It isn't fair
Born March of '86
My birthday's comin', and if I had one wish
Yeah, you'd be it
When you're 'round, I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes like no one else
Baby, make it to me...
Again and again
Again, again, again, again
Never stop
Again, again, a-a-again, again
Never stop, oh
He never really saw me or waited
When we were hookin' up, yeah, he'd a never... last
Last week when I was sad
You said that you knew my eyes changed from kinda green to kinda blue, hey!
They tell me
If I leave him, baby, would you be there?
'Cause maybe, you could be m-m-mine all the t-t-time
I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails
The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distingué traces
That used to be there you could see where
They'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clocktails
Then you came along with your siren's song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your pointed smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong
Again I was wrong
Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so assured
Now life is awful again
And the thoughtful of heart
Could only be a bore
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you I will
And yet you are still
Burning inside my brain
Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush
Life in some small dive
And there I'll be
While I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too
I'm calling 'cause I need you
You know I need you so desperately
You know how bad I can get
And you know how good I can be
I'm calling just to tell you
Get here, I'll make it all worth your while
I can make you some food
Boy, and then I can make you smile
'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
I've got nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
You're with me tonight
You better get here soon
O-or you know what I will do
Got too much time on my hands
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
Nothing, nothing on but the radio
When you get here, boy, we can dance
My hands in the back pockets of your pants
I've turned the lights down low
And I've got nothing on but the radio
With me tonight (oh-oh, nothing)
Nothing on but the radio
Wait 'til I get my hands on you (oh-oh, nothing)
This is The Manifesto of Mother Monster
On G.O.A.T, a Government Owned Alien Territory in space
A birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place
But the birth was not finite, it was infinite
As the wombs numbered and the mitosis of the future began
It was perceived that this infamous moment in life is not temporal, it is eternal
And thus began the beginning of the new race
A race within the race of humanity
A race which bears no prejudice, no judgment
But boundless freedom
But on that same day, as the eternal mother hovered in the multiverse
Another more terrifying birth took place... the birth of evil
And as she herself split into two, rotating in agony between two ultimate forces
The pendulum of choice began its dance
It seems easy, you imagine
To gravitate instantly and unwaveringly towards good
But she wondered, "How can I protect something so perfect without evil?"
I killed my boyfriend and
Left him in the trunk on highway 10
Hahahaha, hahahaha, hahahaha
A-a-a-a
Burqa
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa?
Behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?
Behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?
I can’t help myself
I'm in love
And when I get back from outer space
I'm gonna punch him in his face
He's one
He's a bad, bad boy
Got me twisted, uh
If he's the moon, then I'm eclipsed
I'm so lunar, yeah
When I get to him, run him over with my rocket ship
My eyeliner runs in constellations for you, dear
If only I could reboot my mechanical heart, I'd think clear
Baby, I'm feeling so out of this world
Baby, with you I'm a different girl
Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love
Baby, could we make a home in the stars?
Baby, somewhere in a galaxy far
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-fu-future love?
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-future man?
I want to fu-fuck you as hard as I can
Would you put me in your fu-future plans?
I want a fu-fu-fu-future man
I've been working and engineering, uh
All our chemistries and our situations
Working out our sex equations
And I know I'm no Nostradamus, yeah
When my hair is blond but my heart's brunette
If I'm not on him then at least I'm honest
My mascara runs in constellations for you dear, my dear
If only I could space my brain for a minute
I'd think clear
Fuel me up, and take me into a place we've never been
He is so unreal
He's a mannequin
A synthetic, plastic, rubber man
And I'm relying on, on a shooting star
To get to you my future love, ah-ah
He's my rubber hunk, my mechanic guy
And I'm stuck in his metal rubber eyes
Rubber eyes
My future guy
Huh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Hello, everybody
Get a ride to the West Side
Kiss the girl with her tongue tied
Work it out, 'cause you don't care
Shutdown, like software
Take a sip for the hip-hop if you look for the rest stop
We are just physical creatures of the underworld
She is the queen of the faux-disco scene
Retro, dance, freak (Retro, retro, dance)
Singin' retro dance beats (Retro, retro, freak)
Retro, dance, freak
Undercover
The girl needs a lover
What's up, everybody?
Take a ride on an airplane
Take a bath in champagne
Watch the girls all curtsy for the paparazzi
Let's go everybody
It's time that we rotate, 'cause it's gettin' real late
Singin' retro dance beats
Undercover, oh, the girl, she needs a lover
We love each other so deeply
That I ask you, the sweetheart
Why should we quarrel ever
Why can't we be enough clever, never to part
Every time we say goodbye I die a little
Every time we say goodbye I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go
When you're near
There's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer
But how strange the change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, baby
Last time I thought we had this talk
Boy, you were getting ready to leave
I thought, baby, you were done
'Cause for a while, you could barely look at me
This time, I thought that we'd be fine
That I'd forget the things that you said
I tried crossing out your words
But baby, you can not forget the past (Oh, oh babe)
Cannot forget the past (Oh, oh)
Still, baby...
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love, you see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
Just like you used to be
I can't forget the way you were with me
The second time around
We tried going back to Joe's
That always was our favorite place
Long rides, baby, by the coast
Do you remember where we stayed?
Last time, we were hangin' out
You were acting kind of estranged
Now it's the second time around
I'm sorry, now it's me that feels this way
(My heart just keeps on turning)
It's me that feels this way, babe (Oh, oh babe)
And now you are the one that is hurting
I'm not sure the best way to say this
But I can't pretend to love you no more, babe
This ferris wheel's got me crazy
Maybe the second time around is not meant for us, baby
Not meant for us, baby
Hey, yeah
Meow!
You have got a wild side
You're an animal tonight
I see that you are my type
Wild like a tiger hunting your prey
We'll keep the neighbors up all night
Hot in the jungle, exotic apparel
I can see the way that you're looking at me
Like you're hungry and I am the only thing that you see
Won't tame you, love the way you're watching me
(Watching me)
Baby, I'mma keep you up all night
Gonna tie you up in case you bite
Like an animal, animal
Animal, animal
Baby, I'mma lock you in my cage
And I won't stop until you behave
Baby, I'm gonna keep you up all night
An animal, animal
I'm gonna tie you up in case you bite
I'm an animal, animal
I don't mean to blame you, I'm just trying to tame you
You're an animal, animal
You're a hunter feel your way
I'll do whatever you say
Hold me down and take control (mess up my hair, all crazy sexual)
Do it like an animal (hot in the jungle, exotic apparel)
Hey babe
I'm feelin' something kinda crazy
I know that we got something special, boy
But lately, I've been feelin' naughtier than usual
You see I
I need a love that's crazy, don't you see
I'm looking for someone who can handle me
Need a fire so hot that it burns me so
I'm sorry when I met'cha that I did not know
That you and me, we're kind of incomplete
Need someone the same in-love with me
Give it up, put it up
Not enough, not enough, not enough
I need it
Out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Baby, I'm a toy
Let's play out of control
Cuz I want you more
When your out of control
BABY BABY BABY!
Need a love that's crazy, don't you see
I'm sorry when I met you that I did not know
You and me, we're kinda incomplete
Need someone who's the same, in love with me
Give it up, put it out
Not enough, not enough
Not enough, I mean it
You see I want you here right now
No hesitate
Don’t pull me down
I love you more in my wavelength, in the night
(Cuz you want me
Cuz you want me
Cuz you want me)
I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight
Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play
Bang bang, I shot you down
I used to shoot you down
Music played and people sang
Not for me not church bells ring
Now he's gone I don't know why
Until this day, sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie
Bang bang, he hit the ground
My baby shot me down
'Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek? Then open up the curtains
Baby, it's a freakshow
I wanna know, what do you like?
What would you say, if I said I'd do anything to you you want?
I wanna know
Yeah, it's alright
New positions, bet you would like
You've been screamin', "Stop, yes, please, hon!"
Baby, you've got tricks in my head
Craziest chick you've ever had
I heard what you said in your sleep
You wanna wear, you wanna mend
I like it rough, I like it fast
I know that deep down you're a freak
Just say the magic words and I'll come
I'll hypnotize you
You're gonna lose your mind, don't you know?
'Cause I'm sure you're tired of being certain
When you're alone, what do you dream?
I wanna know your fantasy
Don't matter how wrong it might be
I wanna see, know what I mean
Psycho and fun, sexy and mean
It's just different when you're with me
I want it all
I got a spell, put it on you and I won't tell
Your secret, 'cause I am your slave
You want it hard, you want it tough
I like it long, never enough
I promise that I won't behave
Gimme gimme that
Gimme gimme that, oh
Give you, give you that freaky, freaky, freakshow
Like it like that kitty, kitty cat, oh
Gimme, gimme that
Gimme, gimme that, oh
Wanna show you something that you can't ignore
Show, show, show, show
Midnight at the glamour show on a Sunday Night
Everybody drink a lot of whiskey and wine
We dance like no tomorrow
We’re on Burlesque time
But everybody’s got to work tomorrow at nine
Touch me, t-touch me, baby, but don’t mess up my hair
Love me l-love me crazy, but don’t get too attached
This is a brief affair
Vanity (
pictures in magazines, movie screens
mirrors and cameras, so many beauty queens
Vanity
It’s so good to be (
fabu
lous and glamorous, we love ourselves and no one else
Va-va-va-va-vanity
Va-vanity
Va-va-va-vanity
Nothing wrong with being just a little bit vain
We need a little pretty ’cause this country’s insane
So go ahead and label me whatever you like
But nothings quite as sexy as a woman is fine
Touch me, t-touch me, baby, but don’t mess up my hair (
oh
fabulous and glamorous, we love ourselves and no one else
Watcha lookin' at?
Watcha starin' at?
I’m coming around
I’m sipping on Andre, it’s time
I heard the cutie's in the back, start in the p-party line
Let’s dance, quick round
We’re in the vanity house
We’re covered in sequins, diamonds
We're happy ’cause we're shining
It's been a hard day
Harder night
The rockstar's girlfriend
She lost the fight
Well, it’s alright, baby, I'm nobody’s mother
When you don't want the last cigerette to be over
You fooled me again
Fooled me again with your honest, honest, honest eyes
Again, fooled me again with your dirty mouth full of honest lies
Again, oh, and you fool me again, oh yeah
You're so honest
Full of honest eyes
It’s been two days since he left home
She dried her eyes
Picked up her microphone
She sang, "It’s alright, baby."
I'm nobody’s mother
But I dont want this last cigerette to be over
Again, fooled me again with your dirty mouth full of effin lies
Again, oh, and fool me again, oh yeah
Full of shh... eyes
Again, honest, honest, you're so freaking honest
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
You're so full of it
At least your shh... honest
Eyes
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around, grease around
Hot shit in Brooklyn
Painted green watermelon
That guy's ride is good looking, good looking
He tells that he loves me
And even though I'm real sexy
He loves his car, car, car
He's always with his car, car, car
So I...
Start it, pump it, wash it, bump it
Rub that glitter and grease, he loves it
Me so grimy, make her shiny
There's more glitter and grease behindy
New York, on the weekend
Ain't nothing without your woman
That guy's girl is good looking, good looking
He'd buy me presents, baby
But gas costs him a lot of money
He spends it on his car, car, car
How could you ever let me go?
How could you ever, ever let me go?
I scream your name across the bar
I carry pictures of your Neil Young guitar, guitar
You're my baby
You never made it through to you
If I was the last girl
And you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl, and you were the last boy left here on this planet
Verse 2(verse 1 repeated)
(Happy Ending...)
I saw a shadow, and I knew that it wasn't mine
You and her, I know that you were intertwined
Even though her clothes were on and everything
Your eyes were somewhere else, and you were both to blame
Don't say a word
I'm sure that it won't be enough to erase what I know
Just happens now, what dreams are made of
This is my house, and I won't allow the disrespect
Baby, don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you, no way
'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say
When you're so wrong in what you did but I still feel this way
I can’t believe it or forget it, what I saw today
And if you’re wondering if I’m staying, answer is no way
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it)
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it, babe)
No way-ay-ay-ay
Thought that I saw something I know did not belong to me
But then I thought that there’s no way you would do that to me
And then last week, when you went aside to use your phone
I felt a chill but told myself that it was from the cold
And I just woke up, but I wish that it was a nightmare
'Cause when I have those, it isn’t real like this one is
This is my heart, and I won’t allow the disrespect
Get your things and go
You can take the dinner left over from last night
I made you your favorite goodbye
If I fell in love with you, would you understand me, dear?
Love is weird
I colored you a valentine
Struggled just to stay inside the lines
I lose my mind
I really can't believe I lost myself again
Looking for something crazy
Beautiful love
And now I'm talking in circles again
Have my love, baby
Are you hungry for wonderful? 'Cause I am
Wonderful, 'cause I am
I wrote a song about your eyes
Ate a slice of cherry pie
I cried all night
On a bench inside the park
I'll kiss you slowly in the dark
I'll never stop
Baby, take me for a ride
Maybe get a little high in a place we have never been
Time is nothing but a line
We leave everything behind
It'd be so wonderful, wonderful
Wonderful I am (
beautiful nothing, now
I am, I am (
I'm talking in circles again
It's killing me, boy, yeah
I am, I am
You'll know how wonderful I am
Wonderful I am
Wonderful I
Baby, I've got a lot of questions
You better listen up, please
I wanna know what you want and need
To charge up your batteries
You got the flow and the intentions
Boy, but have you got the miles? (Got the miles, got the miles)
Show me you got the ammunition
That you're good for-for a while (For a while, for a while)
Charge it up (Charge it up now)
'Cause, baby, you could be mine
I need a real soldier
Need you to reload it, bring a reloader
'Cause, babe, I'm gonna be kind
Reloaded-loaded (Lo-oaded, lo-oaded)
You b-better rest up your energy
You better reserve yourself
'Cause tonight, I'm expecting to get plenty
And I won't-won't do it myself
Conserve your juices 'cause I'm gonna
Take you on a marathon
I'm not ridiculous, I'm just a girl
Who likes a man who can go long (Can go long, can go long)
Cause, baby, you could be mine
Baby, you can check yourself
I promise genuinely
That I'm gonna do you right
And I won't complain
Unless you're buggin'
Can’t handle my loving
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Uh, yo momma, get low momma
Hit the flow momma, rock like Obama
Mad like Osama, I'mma, with the drama
I got the whole life, if you got the torch (Sup!)
Hey, my man, run from me, man (Say what)
Hey, my man, run from me (Say what)
Hold up, 'fore this room blow up
I'mma release the clip and reload up, uh
Need you to reload it
Bring a reloader
Dance too much money in the pants
Oh, ratchet sluts!
 ratchet!
Don't fuck that chick she's ratchet!
Now go home, now go home
Don't make me get my hatchet
I know you wanna smash it
Smile though your heart is breaking
Smile even though it's aching
When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by
If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through for you
Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll see that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Da-da-da-da-da-do-do
Da-bo-da-ba-ba-ba-da-bo
Da-da-da-ba-ba-da-ba-da
Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-da

Lady Gaga:
God bless America
Land that I love
Stand beside her and guide her
Through the night with a light from above
This land is your land, this land is my land
This land was made for you and me
One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all...
(Just, just dance)
(Let's play a love game, play a love game)
(Papa-paparazzi)
I'm on the edge!
I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please -
1, 2, 3!
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it; baby -
Stay with me
No he can't read my poker face
(She’s got me like nobody) Come on Houston!
(She’s got me like nobody)
Po-po-po-poker face, po-po-poker face
We are all born superstars
She said, "Cause He made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up, girl and you you'll go far
Cause God makes no mistakes
Just love yourself and you're set
Ooh, there ain't another way
You're black, white, beige, chola descent
Left you outcast, bullied or teased
Cause baby, you were born this way
No matter gay, straight or bi
Lesbian, transgendered life
No matter black, white or beige
Hello, hello, baby
You called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service
In the club, you say, say?
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh?
You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy
K-kind of busy, k-kind of busy
Just a second
It's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with
A drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me
I'm kind of busy
Stop calling, stop calling
I don't want to think anymore!
I've got my head and my heart on the dance floor
I don't want to talk anymore!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Can call all you want, but there's no one home
Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
I've had a little bit too much, much
All of the people start to rush (start to rush by)
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
Just dance, gonna be okay
Da-da-doo-da
Just dance, spin that record, babe
Da-doo-doo-doo
Duh-duh-duh
Dance, dance, dance, just j-j-just dance
How you doing tonight, Texas?
America...World...how you doing tonight?
We're here to make you feel good. You wanna feel good with us?
Hey Dad, Hey Mom.
But baby, I just need one good one...tell me that you'll be the good one... why don't you...stay, stay, stay?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! (Oh! Let's Go!)
Caught in a bad romance (This Super Bowl is what champions are made of!)
Ra Ra-ah-ah-ah
Gaga, "Oh la-la"
I want your ugly
I want your disease
I want your everything
As long as it’s free
I want your love
Love, love, love
I want you drama
The touch of your hand
I want it bad, your bad romance
I want your love and I want your revenge
I want your love and all your lover's revenge
Walk, walk, fashion baby
Work it, move that baby, baby
I want your love and I want your revenge...
Want your bad romance!
(I don't wanna be friends)
Want your bad romance! (Want your bad romance!)
Caught in a bad romance (Want your bad romance!)
Super Bowl 51!
This is the manifesto of Mother Monster:
On GOAT, a government owned territory in space, a birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place. But the birth was not finite, it was infinite. As the wombs numbered and the mitosis of the future began it was perceived that this infamous moment in life is not temporal, it is eternal. And thus began the beginning of the new race; a race within the race of humanity; a race which bears no prejudice, no judgment but boundless freedom. But on that same day as the eternal Mother hovered in the multiverse another, more terrifying, birth took place: the birth of evil
And as she, herself, split into two, rotating in agony between two ultimate forces, the pendulum of choice began its dance. It seems easy, you imagine, to gravitate, instantly and unwaveringly, towards good but she wondered, “How can I protect something so perfect without evil?”
I can feel my heart beating in your hands
My aura and yours meeting in this dance
Pull the trigger I'm ready it's showtime!
Oh oh oh
Welcome to the Panty Circus
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Ladies and gentlemen, Lady Gaga (Gaga)
Who's that girl?
Running round with no clothes on
Heels in the ground
Almost famous on the scene
She looks like a celebrity
She's so shiny
Ain't no way her waist that tiny
Sequins in her hair
Homegirl doesn't care
Baby shake your fanny, fanny
Let me see them pretty panties
Oh oh, I lost my clothes but everybody knows
We get naughty, at the panty party
It's time to get undressed and make it glamorous
Let's get naughty, at the panty party
Oh whoah, whoah ah
What are you doing over there?
We're gonna play in underwear
Spanky pants, curious
Bubble wraper, furious
She's so pretty
Bet you she's from New York City
...It's been oolong since I've had a sip
And I get this feeling I need a green detox
The truth will be the winner tonight....
...Without the milk or sweet honey...
...That's the truth, Tea...
It's too much a mess and a stress to figure out
And too much pressure on us, babe
Last night you took me to the mall
And then it started to get physical
But we've only been on one date, baby
Yeah, and it was fun 'til you start acting crazy
I don't really find it very cute or sexy
When you call or incessantly t-t-text me
Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love
But it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
I can't live with you, yes it's true
Or live without the kind of guy that I'm about
You kiss me like a rockstar
And you always wanna hold my hand
Don't be, don't be (dirty ice cream)
Don't be, don't be
Oh no, don't be, don't be
One, two
I think I love you
You got ripped jeans
I'm only nineteen, what do you wanna do?
You got your cigarette
I got my headset
We're two of a kind
You're spades, and I'm diamonds
And you know that you
Yeah, you can see clearly that I am the one you want
But I must admit that I'm everything you're not
Yeah, I am red, you are blue
I'm old school and you're so new
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
When you're cold, I like to burn
I cut lines, you wait you turn
Don't shoot
My heart is on mute
Our physical dreams are only skin deep
How do you wanna groove?
D'you hear my gun ring? (Oh, yeah)
You're mine, you're there, you'll hear that
I am all up inside your head
Now you can see clearly that I am the one you want
You won't forget me when I'm gone
This feels so good, it can't be wrong
I'd recommend a one night stand
I know we're just friends, but you're my kind of man
Just for tonight
Even though I'm red, you are blue
I know we could be great for tonight
When you're cold, I'll make it burn
You'll never have to wait your turn
Yeah, I guess I could forgive you tonight
I'll cut lines, you'll wait your turn
Oh oh oh oh
Everybody wants the lights lights
All the flashes, cause we're gonna rock the night, night
Break out your glasses
Tonight you are a superstar, superstar, superstar
Everybody wants the lights, lights
I want your number
Did I see you on the TV?
I wonder, I wonder
You got that something
That junoesque baby, I'm feeling love connection
Have we met before? (baby, cause I think I've seen you)
In a movie or on the radio? (I don't know, but I want you)
I'm not certain, but let's dance some more (baby, cause I think I've seen you)
Tonight you'll be my superstar
Take out your glasses
Want you to text me
I bet you could really Hollywood kiss me (Hollywood kiss me)
You've got that something
Were you in that movie with Scarlett Johansson? (Scarlett Johansson)
Have we met before (baby, cause I think I've seen you)
In a movie or on the radio? (I don't know but I want you)
I'm not certain but let's dance some more (baby, cause I think I've seen you)
Tonight you'll be my superstar, tonight you'll be my superstar
All the flashes, cause we're gonna rock the night life
Don't really know who you are, but tonight you're gonna be my superstar
Come on baby move with me, can't you see?
I'm a celebrity
Hold me, daddy, real tight
They'll take our picture in the spotlight
Yeah, I know you love that limelight
And how that DJ's spinning tonight (

Gonna paint the town pink
We don't care what you think, sorry
Everybody wants to be like us
Filthy glamorous
We know how to party
Sexy ugly

Real hot body
Hold your mama real tight
She's turning colors in the black light
Sound phobic polite
Don't be afraid to shake that butt right
You sex pot, you sex pot
You are a sex pot, you are a sex pot
You, sex and pot, yeah
Be like us
I don't know why you' hurt, inside
Or what was said to make, you, cry
I hope that you can see you are the greatest thing to me
And when, you' feeling like you're not enough
I'll give you wings, I'll lift you up
I hope that you can see you are the greatest, greatest thing to me
I don't wa-wanna waste another day
I'm thinking of you, the man of my day
I walk and see you once another day
'Cause when I'm with you, I fall apart
I see your permanently broken heart
Baby, you're the greatest to me
Know, no matter what, what, what
I'll give you wings, i'll lift you up
Yeah
Blueberry kisses
My lips, they miss his, oh, yeah
Where did you go now?
Where did you go?
I told you baby, I'd love you maybe
But you stopped the clock the second time around
I need you around, 'round, 'round (
blueberry kisses
'Round and around
'Round and around, and around
The muffin man, he misses them kisses, yeah
Where did they go now?
I told you baby, I'd L-O-V you maybe
Yeah, I know it's crazy
But I've been feeling lately that I need you around-ou-ou-ou-ound
This is beat is so funny
We made it with their money
Hahahahahahahahahahaha
Fancy, fancy, you're so fancy
You so fancy
Ooh, ah
Huh
See that girl, watch her go
Red high heels and pretty toes
Silly puddy, dungaroos
Lady's got a killer groove
And you've got a lot to lose
All the famous boys and girls stand around and pose
Everybody knows at The Boom Boom Room
We all take off our clothes
Fancy clothes
Take off your fancy clothes
Oh baby, don't be shy
Fashion's got a lazy eye
Everybody, let's take off our fancy pants tonight
Grab those tight and lacy bottoms
Don't leave home without 'em
Let's take off our fancy pants tonight
See that boy, watch him go
Blue jeans with an ass like "Whoa"
Philly suddy, sungarood
Monkey's got a killer groove
A girl's got a lot to lose
All the famous boys and girls put it up their nose
Everybody knows in The Boom Boom Room
There he goes
My baby walks so slow
Sexual tic-tac-toe
Yeah, I know we both know it isn't time
But would you be m-mine?
We'll never get too far
Just you, me and the bar
So in a ménage à trois sometimes
Would you be m-mine?
Oh baby, lights on, but your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone with this fever, fever, yeah
Now, I'm gonna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever, yeah
There it goes
You stole my soul, and so
'Cause sweetheart, no-no-nobody a-no-no-knows
They're occupied
Tell me you'll be mine
Let's get inside your car
Just you, me and the stars
Kind of ménage à trois sometimes
Could you be m-mine?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fever, fever, yeah
Don’t belong to any city
Don’t belong to any man
Keeping it to myself but
You’re on my mind again
I’m not the kind to admit
Babe when you’re under my skin
One night with you in my head
Kind we could not forget
Yeah, you’ve been haunting me
But this ain’t really me
Baby can’t you see
What you give you get?
I know you got regrets
And every year
In mid-November
I’m the one you’ll remember
Before I let you go
Something that you should know
Can’t say that I was wrong but
Babe it has been so long
I’m not the kind to admit
Babe when you’re under my skin
One look, and I'm done
One glance from your eyes, and I'm captivated
The taste of your skin
The warmth of your hungry lips
Has me so taken, and I...
Love the way you can make me dance from miles away
When I'm with you, I'm so sedated
I'm captivated by you
You're just like the wind
'Cause everything moves away when you're around it
The sun is just like the sound of your voice in the morning
When you light my world up, and I...
When I'm with you, I'm never jaded
I'm captivated
Oh, I'll never stop believing in this crazy love we're leading
Oh, sugar, hold me closer and make me sweeter
I need you
I love you
So, please, show me that smile
Make me laugh for just a little while
Then breathe me one breath
I only need one to fill the emptiness, and I...
It's been so long, but now I've waited
And I'm captivated
I never ever thought I'd live away
From everybody that I love and say goodbye
Now I'm the princess of a downtown train
Where everybody here, they know my game
But when I walk down the street I hear them say
"There she goes, that crazy girl...
She thinks she's something in this world."
So I'mma close my ears and dream 'cause life is never really what it seems
In every mystery, there's a truth
You know I'm telling, I'm telling you, uh-uh
No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
Yeah, you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now
On every street there is a memory
A time and place where we can never be again, uh-uh-uh-oh
Street lights glow red, green and yellow too
Do you let signs tell you what to do?
Yeah, when you say stop, be sure that I'll say "go"
To the stars and land
Fire can't burn these hands
But I just close my eyes and dream
You can't deny me, my strong mean
Hey
And you can't stop me
Go ahead and don't believe
Cause everyone needs a way to breathe, and love, and dream
You can't stop me
I never ever thought I'd live away from everybody that I love and say goodbye
I can't remember when you looked at me and cried
Said something broke inside of you
Were my best friend
Whatever come our way, you know I'm your girl 'til the end
And when I'll finally go away
I know you'll look for me one day
When you let love down
Oh, you let love down
I don't have to remind you, but you know that I'm around
Oh, you let me down
Get a little let down
Let it down
I can't remember when you put your hand on mine
But couldn't play in time
When we, yeah, when we're not together
Just sing a little song
Blueberry kisses forever
Yeah, when I'll finally go away (
when I'll finally go away
It's so sad
Get a little love down
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't let me down
Oh, don't let me down
Can't let love down

Jean-Paul Sartre
Hope you don’t think my obsession is awkward
There’s no particular thing that I want, want, want
There’s no particular drug that I love, love, love
But when I can’t find my stache I give up, up, up, up
I need to deal with myself and get messed up, messed up, messed up
Can you feed my love
Cannabis?
DJ Zedd
Anton
, turn it up
Let’s party, let’s get messed up
Let’s get messed up
You’re so messed up
Psychotic music head
We gon' grab the mics and get 'em off the wall
So everybody in here can stop snoring
Let’s get into trouble, lots of trouble
Rock star, you know how to rock hard
Hello midnight lover-lover
Hold that lady tighter
Shoot that bullet through her
My heart beats just like a cherry soda in the summer
Go, go, go
Don't be difficult about it
Get off it
Off the wall (get your ass)
Off the wall (throw that girl)
Against the wall
Retro physical
Off the wall (work that boy)
So sexual
Let's get down to business, funny business
In the middle of the night, he starts to get feisty
Let's get into trouble, lots of trouble
There are killers and blonde bunnies
They dance for money
Everyone is famous
Running 'round real aimlessly
We dance for the garage team
In between this spaces, happiness can trace it down
We're not gonna leave this town
Off the wall (do that, girl)
I've got no friends
I'm my own queen
But I'm living on, living on the radio, that's my dream
Stone river eyes, and a lonely heart
If I'm living on the radio, they won't tear me apart
10 stems and roses on a tree
10 steps, and lonely nights, but you still got me
On the road, road paved in gold
Baby you must believe
Baby you must be free
Keep living on, living on the radio, that's your dream
Baby you've got a friend
And so many little monsters, yeah
Keep living on, living on the radio
And when there's nowhere to go
And all your friends are gone
And you've only got your daddy to call
You can be all right honey
'Cause your songs are on the radio
'Cause you're sure to miss all the caviar
The champagne, and the sold-out shows
But we'll be all right honey
It's funny how things, they change
The clouds they part
Rearrange for me
Faces of strangers and I have no familiars to help me see
Where is home?
I want you to know
That I wish you were here
I wish you were here
Sometimes I wonder if God hides out in cities to set us free
'Cause, yeah, this room is crowded, but I am so alone in it
Help me, please
And I will be strong
I won't give in
I won't deny you
I know where we've been
I'm so much more than all of my fears
Than all of these tears
My tears, yeah
I'm not bad, I just sound that way!
All the girls, they like their presents like their presents
When boys wrap them up in ribbons, ribbons, ribbons
Doesn't matter if they're precious or expensive if they're well thought out
Sexed up, wrapped right
Every time, get in line, and give me mine
We like black, white, big, striped, polka-dotted, cafe-lotted
Presents come in many sizes
Wrap them up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up
I'm not a Hallmark card expression
Need material attention
Wrapped in ribbons, Richard Simmons
Silly ribbons, ribbons, ribbons!
If you can't afford the best
Don't be stressed, take a rest
Get a job, do it right
It's my birthday all night
We like black, white, big, striped, famous, super-sized ribbons
Don't care what you put inside them
Wrap it all in ribbons
It's the lifestyle that I like
I'll give you yours, you give me mine
But don't forget to wrap them up in pretty, pretty ribbons
Only difference between downtown and uptown
Is therapy and valium
Therapy and valium
Not lying when I say this, there's a price to being famous
Yeah, it's therapy and valium
It's not complicated, just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up
Wrap...
Wrap them presents up, wrap them presents up
I really can't stay

We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique
Here we go round on the boulevard
Top cutting the cake till the sugar flow, stop, don't stop (it's a record)
Drip drip drip, baby watch me melt
Take a sip sip sip, but it doesn't help me stop, can't stop (it's a record)
Don't tell me you love me
In the middle of summer
Don't say that you need me
Don't tell me you love me when it's tragic
And my heart's in the blender
Yeah baby we're plastic
And we'll melt in the summer, melt in the summer
Wire that girl for the electronic
Underground scene where the beat is chronic, yeah
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique), oh yeah
Take a sip sip sip, but it doesn't help, it's bad, so bad (it's a record)
We gotta synthetic situation
And we dance with no intermission
Mister shouldn't have kissed her
Before the rock show was o-o-over
Here we go-go, sir
We're making time, it's a record, record, record
In the middle of the summer
Melt in the summer
He went to them, they turned away
He just wanted something to eat, a place to love, a place to pray
In God we trust, and it's okay
He said, "I'm black, latin, and gay...
I went to them, they turned away."
Where life is holding you down
And you're having trouble finding peace
You gotta be brave
Be brave, until you're bleeding
Where life is holding you hard in a place that it don't want to be
You gotta posh life
'Cause life is all you need
We live a posh life
And the world says we're not brave until we bleed
You gotta trust in the future of us
Believe posh life
We're nothing but our leather and our dreams
Posh life
Posh life, until we bleed
Grew up north of the Florida Bay
Nineteen, moved to the big city to find a dream, to find a way
Ooh, burning concrete of lower east
Inscribing sharpie William's "H"
Passionately only serving him, yeah
A posh life
Posh like
This ain't no chapel, ain't no Pauper's prison
We love this posh life for just one reason
We got each other when the church ain't giving
The world says we're not brave until we bleed
Believe
What do you say we get outta here kid?
One lost lady and the radio creep
Got your hands in my pockets while you spinnin' the beat
The vinyl spins fast while we trippin' on that
She said ''we can't stand still"
One trick bunny and a haunting man
Got lost in the woods with a gun in the hand
She said ''hey 
love child
, take me back''
I said ''we can't stand still"
Shake your head cause she wants you
Close your eyes and see through
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming of the girls names
Feel so retrosexual
 (sexual)
Heard a story 'bout the medicine man
Drove straight to the coast in his minivan
He learned the ways of the local dudes
He said ''I can't stand still"
Missy Brown went to pristine high
Met the medicine man for a token around
She said ''It's been so long since we got down''
He said ''I can't stand still''
The girls go round and round
The boys go round and round
If the world goes round and round
We all go round and round
What do you saw? Get outta here kid!
Feel so retrosexual (sexual)
Feel so retrosexual, sexual, sexual, sexual
Sexual
Where did they go?
Where did everybody go?
We could've tried
Why did everybody cry if you weren't mine?
And now everything is gonna change
You made your mind up
Well, my friends, you've got a lot to learn, you do
Why do we deny ourselves in terms of love?
I'm at a loss, so well, oh well
Oh well
Can't find the words
But hey, man, everybody hurts
When it doesn't work
Your love drowned us in a hole
You never ever wanted her to grow
To grow
Oh, oh
Why?
If everything is gonna change, was it worth it?
Oh, my friends, you've got a lot to learn, you do
You weren't strong enough, oh well, for me...
Oh well, oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh well
I'm just an Onion Girl at heart
You can't pull a tear or peel me apart
Oh-oh-oh
I need somebody who calls my name
When clouds are smokin up my way
You get me through these cha-changing skies
I don't wanna be afraid again
It's just that I could use a friend
Give me something that I can wrestle to the ground
There isn't anything that I can't handle now-iow
Believe me when I say that I will be okay
And listen, there's some voice and my cha-changing skies
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
And I don't wanna be the kind to cry
I wanna dance right through the night
Know that I am not emotional
It's just that I don't wanna fall without my parachute, tonight
Ow, come here boy
I met a drummer last week at a pool bar down
B-by the shore
With a body like that and your stonewashed eyes
I want you more
He cried, "Mother, what'd you do to me?"
I said, "Mother, mother, mother's for babies, call me kitty."
Yeah, shake your kitty
Shake your kitty (
meow
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me
Shake your kitty
Shake your shake
Shake shake
Shake your sh-shake
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake
I took a drummer by the hand to the jukebox
Then we hit the floor
With your Van Halen pin and your dark side burns
You never call me by my name, but I still want you
You play some pretty tricky games, but I still want you
Your best friend drives a fancy car, but I still want you
You're working every hour, but, but I still want you, yeah
If you see a girl this pretty shake her, shake her, shake her kitty
When you see a girl that's pretty shake it, shake it, shake that kitty
Meow
Uh, uh-oh
Wait, I think it's time
Your fire's lit and so is mine
Go turn out the light
Don't be afraid
Tonight's the night
And I won't, I won't try to change you
But I will, I will if you want me to
Yeah, it always brings me down when you're not around
I still need you
Oh, you do something for me, baby
And I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
Oh, you do something crazy to me
And I feel so down when you're not around
Boy, we're almost there
I'll lay your clothes over my chair
Pull the shades down low
We're both ready to lose control
And I won't, I won't try to tame you
And I cannot control it lately
Oh, you do something for me baby
La la la la la la la la
You always bring me down
Baby I'm not naive I know you're broken
I know you were once whole but now you're broken
You don't know which part of yours been stolen
But what you're looking for?
You gotta go deep
Deeper than an ocean
Deeper than the bluest blue
Listen what I am telling you
You gotta go deep, deep. deep
Past your limit
Deep, deep, deep
Til you really fell it
And I will swim all the way down to you
Baby we all have fear for going under
But you can't drink the rain without some thunder
You must travel far to find God's wonder
What you don't dig, for you can't be discovered

WARNING! These lyrics are what fans remembered from the ArtRAVE: The ARTPOP Ball, and from the snippet. They are in no specific order
I don't remember much from last Sunday and I'm probably reaching"
"I'm not your Billie Jean"
"I could be your thriller
Billie Jean is still pregnant
I'm not worthy of you, liar
I'm not worthy of you, sire."
"You never know
I could be Michael
The next Michael Jackson"
"You're the king and I'm not worthy."
"So don't leave me yet."
Last week I saw you out
And I knew we would be a match in Heaven
Just the coolest kind of team
I, I know there ain’t no way that we won’t
'Cause we won’t stop 'til we go, go the distance
We’re a distance
Baby, I believe it
I still believe it
And you know we won’t be defeated
In my heart, I believe it
Yeah, you and me are gonna win it, baby
I’m gonna take you out, take you out, take you out
We’re gonna show this town what I know we’re about
Shoot it, run it, what’s it called?
Everybody loves it (football)
I've got the feeling that this year could be the one
We're gonna tear it up and burn out everyone
'Cause we won’t stop 'tll we go, go the distance
Everybody loves it (Football)
New York, London, Paris, Munich
Everybody talk about pop music
And you know won’t be defeated
I am having a dreams as I lay me down to sleep
Gaze electronica daze
Beautiful charades
Colors and rage
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth
My missionaries hidin' in foreign trenches
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Like just The Doors' Love Her Madly and let her in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my blonde head on a silver plate
Just a GaGa on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be queen?
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
For some reason that I can't explain
I know Yves Saint Laurent, no, he won't call my name
But that was when I ruled the world
The fame won't change us if we don't let it
I know Saint Mary won't call my name
Ruled the world
We are a generation twisted by a myth
Confused and ludicrous
Holding on to love
Consumed by all the pleasures in our midst
A life without the lips we've kissed, and losing all control
We're gonna start a resistance
So we want independence
We're gonna give the world some of this
Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
We'll live together in peace, love, solitude, and happiness
Fame is our felony
We're so in love with it
Some superstars and masochists who don't know where to go
But the poets and the fathers of our time
Put down their weapons in their arms, and know what they must do
I am fashion, music, groove
Baby, I was made to move
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy, if you try
No hell below us
And only Matthew in the sky
Imagine all the people living for today
Ah-ah-oh-oh-oh
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday that you'll join us
And the world will live as one
People of the nation
Are you listening?
It isn't equal if it's sometimes
I want a real democracy
Imagine all the people
Could love equally
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger, oh yeah
Just the brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing in the world
With nothing to hate, and nothing to think
Just people to love, and friends to have drinks
Oh-oh, yeah
If I handed you the world
Why'd you break mine?
If I gave you the world
Why'd you shake mine?
Cause the truth is, I love you
But the truth is, I can't be with you
I guess, I'm In Like With You
We've got nothing left to lose but limousines and attitudes
Yeah, we're banking on us
Oh, baby, it's crazy
We've got nothing left to make but icing on this little cake
Fashion sense and vanity consume us, 'cause we...
We want that Kandy Life
For me, I'd like that Kandy Life
Could we get a taste of that Kandy Life?
I know our style might be abridged
But we are the ones, bitch
We got sour grapes to fry to limit this credit card life
We're banking on hits
We've got nothing left to lose but reservations and good booze
Copy me, celebrities consume us, 'cause we...
I say change your pants
And meet me in the bathroom for a private tour and dance
We'll share our candy
I'm not your buddy, baby
Vanity's for me
Copy me, 'cause we...
I don’t speak German, but I can if you like, ow!
(If you like...)
Es kumpent üste monstère
Aus-be aus-can-be flaugen, begun be uske-be blair
Es kumpent madre monstère
I’ll take you out tonight
Say whatever you like
I don’t speak German, but I can if you like
(Aus-be aus-can-be flaugen, fräulein uske-be clair...)
I...
Fight for your right
Ich schleiban aus-be aus-can-be flaugen
Scheiße, scheiße be mine
Scheiße, be mine
Put on a show tonight
Do whatever you like
(Ich schleiban austa be clair, es kumpent madre monstère
Aus-be aus-can-be flaugen, fräulein uske-be clair)
(Ich schleiban aus-be aus-can-be flaugen, fräulein uske-be clair...)
I won't break down today
Another brick's in my way of shadows
The promises they made
Regret themselves, and say "this is too hard"
Yeah, they say you grow when you don't succeed
But it's hard to breathe when no one believes in me
So let the sound bring me back
Sounds have no regrets
And before you know it
I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Right to the stars and beyond
Whenever you're afraid, or someone's far away
Never give in
'Cause happily we'll reign when consequences change
Believe you can win
Your words and be gone
I'll take your words and be gone

Hey there, weathergirl
She’s some kind of tramp
With fuzzy hands and a smoking chain
Yeah, all the boys karaoke screen
Keep that shit reel cool
Lyrics From Snippet
Well why does it feel so good?
The full lyrics of the song will be available soon
Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released
When I was younger, I was at some point, born.
I grew in both IQ and EQ and as that happened I discovered that I was living in two realities at once.
They fought all the time and yet I made space for both of them for a reason I can't explain.
One reality I experienced was my Earth reality. The day, today, painting of what I was taught was my natural state in life.
At the time I also experienced a dream simultaneously and this dream was in combat with my Earth reality at all times.
A vision where I perform my thoughts for the world, a world where I mattered in a different way.
A world where I was valued for different things.
And in this world I was kind and that kindness spread through people, through sound.
This was the birth of Chromatica.
Love is an element on Chromatica, like earth, wind, fire, water.
It's a natural force and it's the only way that I can organize this super organism that is the Earth, it's by making it one whole thing.
Where time and linear structure don't matter, they don't exist.
We are all love.
I am love.
So it's everything around us.
It's how we work.
It's the thing we both initiate and respond to.
It's why everything happens, both good and bad.
It's the only way that I can make things simple.
And why shouldn't it be simple?
I breathe in and out love.
I don't believe it to be a choice other than I choose to breathe.
That is Chromatica.
It is how I do hard things.
It's neither right nor wrong nor is it greater or less than any other perspective on life.
No one thing is greater than another.
Kindness rules all things.
It simply is and it's mine.
You can have it too, though.
My best friend says "Sharing is caring" but we both know that I don't need to share your perspective with you for us both to care.
The Manifesto of Chromatica it's never-ending, I cannot finish it here.
It would be declaring I would never make music or be Lady Gaga again, which would mean I would stop being myself.
This manifesto finale marks the new beginning of my life.
One where I acknowledge that sound is my life force and that Lady Gaga is the mystery that carries it.
Chromatica can't end, it's how I make sense of things.
That's what you should tell people if they ask you what it is.
And for what is worth I think we all need that to make sense of things even if at times it feels absurd.
After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy I'm awake
With no Bromo Seltzer handy
I don't even shake
Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half pint imitation
Put me on the blink
But I'm wild again, beguiled again
Simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I
I could not sleep and wouldn't sleep
Till love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Oh I lost my heart, but what of it?
He is cold I agree
They can laugh, but I love him
And so the laugh's on me
I'll sing to him, bring spring to him
And long for the day when I cling to him
He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms
Oh!
I've sinned a lot, I mean a lot
But now I'm sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched! Bothered! And bewildered, am I
You're like the definition of negative
Always complainin', you're such a pessimist
(Your) Cup is always half empty
I'm just so sick of it
I got a different perspective
(My) Cup is half full
(My) Sky is never gray
(You...) You can't bring be down anymore baby
(My) Future is bright
(Can't) Wait to face the day
There's one thing you should know about me. (Mee...)
Im an optimist. (Stop!)
So positive. (Bitch!)
You'll never get another chance with me baby
Im an optimist. (Out!)
Your chances blown, boy you're gone, spread your negativity
(I'm an optimist, toppop-timist-toppop-timist)
You're such a downer, You're never satisfied
Lucky for me, there's always a silver line
On the horizon, so boy dont even try
Injectin' me with your negative vibes
Welcome To Chromatica
I Hope You Like Your Stay
You're Gonna Be On The Journey Of Your Life!
Welcome To Chromatica
I Hope You Like Your Stay
Cause This is Out Of Your World!
Chromatica!
This Is Chromatica!
Ch-Ch-Chromatica!
Earth Is Cancelled
This is Chromatica!

-Scheiße-
When I wrote this song many years ago I said I wish that I could dance on one single prayer
I wish I could be strong without permission
But it’s a really strange thing, strength
‘Cause you gotta know what weakness feels like to have it
You gotta put up with some bull s*
So you know, I wrote about a nice sentiment about strength, and being a woman in this very sentimental song
:m SCHEIBE!
This one’s for the girls. Put your hands up, let’s dance

Every single day yeah I dig a grave, then I sit inside it wondering if I’ll behave. It’s a game I play, and I hate to say you’re the worst thing and best thing that’s happened to me
I was frightened when I made it
They called me in
Walked in through the door
They called me weird
Bitch, now I'm a household name
You've seen the power that I've held
Beauty isn't in the eye of the beholder
It's how you see yourself
Now you're about to see what I do next

‘Cause we’re drivin’ with sass
Want you to pump up my ride

All the children just clap your hands
Everybody just clap your hands
And have a ball, y'all
All the children just clap your hands, (clap your hands)
:
I've always been looking
Been trying, been yearning
Continually seeking
And searching and burning
Exploring and hunting
And everywhere turning
For that power fountain
That fountain of truth
No answers at all in the streets or the mall
I saw it in the ocean, found raging emotion
Nothing is stable
I'm really not able to find that power fountain
The future is yours
The time is now
The place is here
Shout now
So every kid can hear
So every woman and man in the land can understand the new world
Inherited by the children
Free from famine or disease
That's right
Free from the gun and the knife
Forever, for life
Free from all the mistakes that we made in the past
Throw your hands in the air and let the truth last
You got the power
The wind in every hour
To blossom like a flower under the rain shower
The reach like the branch of the tree up in the sky
So reach high and soar with the eagles as we fly
Flight of great heights
Fight the great fights
Strong and sing songs of wrongs just made right
And the never ending search for the fountain of youth
In your youth you're bound to find a fountain of truth
I've looked in the city
A place without pity
Seen mountains of wealth
Not fountains of health
I'm really not able to find that powerful fountain
That fountain of the truth
Fountain of truth

And I can see you all out there and I’m thinking about the stage, and the lights and how I’m gonna do the thing
And then sometimes I get a phone call right before and I’m like who is calling me?
I got a sold out arena waiting and I’m kinda busy right now!
Hello, hello, babx, you called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you see, see
MY TELEPHONE ! MY TELEPHONE ! AND YOURE NOT GONNA REACH MY TELEPHONE !
*punch air*
I used to think that I was stupid
Worthless weak and wrong
A mockingbird without a song
I was small inside
Left and ride
On a one-way train to be Milhouse's bride
End this song, end it right here!
I love NPR and jazz guitars
And may design a solar car
I'm Lisa Simpson superstar
You've got a great big heart
That's at the top of the chart
Lisa Simpson
Lisa Simpson superstar
You're a superstar
Lyrics will be provided at release

That’s a very little monster in there *points fan* Hello! I can see you ;)
You know, did anybody get to go to the artr*ve? That was a party
Oh you know, that was my last tour, the artr*ave
And, when I went on tour, I went to my home, which is the first first home I’ve ever had, huh
And I walked around and I said, what am I gonna do now, in this house? Am I gonna write more music?
And I’m gonna go on tour again, ‘cause that’s really what I want to do
And I thought what am I gonna write about? I want so badly to relate to people that haven’t related to me yet, not because I’m
You know, don’t love the fans I have but I think it’s important you know to grab somebody else’s f* hat and try to walk in their sh* for a little while
So I made sure this album, Joanne, that I didn’t just honor the more personal sentiments
I made sure also to honor the h** in my heart
The trap of my spirit
You know one day, I’m gonna have a kid in one arm and a glass of Pxnot Grigio in the other
And as long as I keep dancin’ in circles it’ll feel real good to be lonely. LET’S GO!
Tap down those boots while I. *spin around the circle*

And for those of you wondering tonight, you might be saying, who’s Joanne? *laughs*
And that person, Joanne, is two things. Number 1, my middle name is Joanne, given to me by my parents
But Joanne, was also the name of my father’s sister who I was named after. She died in 1974 of lupus
This loss of my family, it travelled decades and generations that I thought she would be like an angel, from the dinner table
I thought of her and my parents at night, and I study her, so that I might be able to understand my father
So when I asked of all of you tonight, it’s even the joyest moment that we get to spend all together, knowing I know
And many of you know that there are people all over the world they could never afford to go see a live show like this, you are all so very lucky
And as we got time to ask you, I would ask you to honor your own pain in this moment, and take yourself back to that place where you were blasted and your life was changed so much
So much that you don’t even remember who you were before
For me, that pain has only one name, and it’s Joanne
*whispers* one, two, three
*plays guitar*
Heaven’s not ready for you…
Girl, where do you think you’re going, where do you think you’re going, going girl?
Girl, where do you think you’re going! Girl
We both know, things don’t work that way
I promised I, wouldn’t say goodbye, so I grin, and my voice gets thin
Girl, where do you think you’re going?
Honestly I know where you’re going
And I’ll still love you even if I can’t see you anymore. Can’t wait to see you soar
Joanne middle stop speech:
Hello gentlemen
I guess what I’m trying to say is I was trying to figure out myself a little better, and, instead of just staring at myself
I tried to figure out my dad, and my mom, and their pain. And it led me right back home
Girl, where do you think you’re going, where do you think you’re going, going girl!
Girl, where do you think you’re going, where do you think you’re going, going, gi-oh-rl!
Call me Joanne
Xo Joanne
XoXo all our pain, makes us this way, it made me who I am

Lady Gaga, Gaga
Stephen Fry: I know people talk to you about all the same things but one of the things I just wanted to talk to you about, because it’s so obvious coming here, is the thing I think that you always say is most important to you, which is the fans, and they’re all outside and I gather you took them out some hot chocolate?
Lady Gaga: Actually, well, I sent them hot chocolate yesterday and macaroons, and then today I had press all day and I felt bad because I usually would leave the hotel and I would go to say “hi” but I knew that I wouldn’t have time and they’d be waiting all day, so I just went down and I brought them some fresh cookies and flowers.
SF: Ooooh! And do you find there’s a difference between your fans in different countries or is there a sort of similarity: is there a kind of Gaga fan who has a commonality?
LG: Yes, there is. The little monsters are a community and it’s kind of nice that everywhere I go they create a little home for me.
SF: Both those who, I suppose, describe themselves as your critics and those who adore you, as I do I’m unashamed to say, would concentrate on the fact that you are quite happy to be self consciously a spokesman for the dispossessed, the marginal, the freakish, the outsider, the sexually different, the ugly, the fat, the one who doesn’t fit in, the one who feels outside the tribe, if you like.
LG: Yes, it could be anybody.
SF: Which, in fact, is most of us. None of us really feels we belong, just some of us are better at hiding it than others.
LG: I think so. Some of us wear the mask prouder than others.
SF: Yes. Exactly. And the title of this album is the one that most directly addresses that, I suppose, Born This Way and the title song of it.
LG: Yes. The album is about being able to be reborn over and over again throughout your life.
SF: Oh, so it’s not just that God made me gay or God made me lesbian or God made me bi, and that’s who I am?
LG: No.
SF: It’s about being reborn, is it?
LG: No, not really.

When they're young, all Little Monsters learn that they are scary
Ugly, stupid, shunned by Cupid, overweight, and hairy
But every Monster needs to find that secret deep inside
That transfers Dr. Jekyl into sexy Mr. Hyde
All my Monsters are beautiful, discostoodiful, squarerootiful, oldcootiful
Monsters don't need implants or a bitchin' Monster car
Monsters only need to love the Monsters that they are
Oh yeah! Gaga, dada, jawa, PEACE, ew

To be announced soon
She confirmed she had a song with SOPHIE but never came out since Chromatica released
I'm a powerbottom
I like to be underneath
I like to take control like a man
I know that you all have been feeling a tremendous range of emotions. Since we've all have heard about this horrible, hateful attack on Orlando and on your and our community. As we have now witnessed the largest mass shooting in American history. I can't help but feel that this level of hatred, like all predigital crimes, this is an attack on humanity itself. This is an attack on everyone. Tonight I gather humbly with you. As a human being: in peace, in sincerity, in commitment, in solidarity. To take a real moment and mourn the tragic loss of these innocent, beautiful people. And let's all today pledge an allegiance of love to them, and to their families, who are suffering so deeply. They are sons and daughters, they're fathers and mothers, they are all our brothers and our sisters. But tonight I will not allow my anger and outrage over this attack to overshadow our need to honour those who are grieving truly for their lost ones. Lost members of the LGBT community. I hope you know that myself and so many are your allies. Not only me but everyone here, we represent the compassion and the loyalty of millions of people around the world that believe in you, you are not alone. You are not alone. Tomorrow I hope that we all raise thoughtfully and loudly towards solutions. But tonight and right now, Orlando, we are united with you and we are here to remember.

Fashion, love, sex, money, fame, art, pornography, death
House music, New York city
House music, New York, respect
Смотри, в глазах эстетика
Моя любовь - твоя косметика
Стабильнее чувств Эдика
Но всё в истериках
Я всё время не с теми
Не понятно кто от
В попытках крушит стены
Развиваясь как флаг со старт системе
Заткнись, babe!
Слишком быстро потеряла голову
Ищешь меня по любому поводу
Но я не на проводе и вроде холоден
А тебе до этого вовсе нет дела
Рискни, babe!
Я дарю тебе канистру с бензой
Подожги следы и я оставлю с бензо
Ты знаешь, тебе со мной нельзя
Только хочешь, чтобы взял тебя, снова взял тебя
Скинь свой hoodie, голосом mute
Ты на мне, it`s so qute
Я в тебе, absolute
Времени нет, i feel so good
Там не BBS
Кредо VVN (Shake that ass)
Кинул на пол рэкс
Он нажат на съезд
Снова хочет сесть
Там мне место есть
Ты мой лучший key
Ставлю на всех крест
Чувствую success
Клик-клик, вызвал майбах
Её губы шик-шик
Раз мне drive one
Ряд блестит, блик
Спел я ей лайвом
Всю ночь не спит и
Хочет быть пьяной (Эй)
Прыгает, как лоурайдер
Никаких чувств
Вотт весь мой райдер
Чувствую пульс
Скользит как слайдер
Babe, прощай
Мы в разных вайбах!
You know what I like
Know-Know I
Do it
Feel like getting dirty now
1, 2, 3 - My pants are down
Not gonna reason, you're gonna do whatever I like
'Cause I'm happy as a clam tonight
I want everything, baby
Everything, baby
You know what I like. (You know what I like)
I need everything, baby
Everything, baby
And you're doing me right
When you're out with all your friends
And you got money to spend
Do me right-right
Do me right. (Do it, do it)
When I tell that I wanna
In the club, or in the corner
Lick me, slap me, do it, do it
Do me right, there's nothing to it
It's 'bout time you ice my cake
Want someone who milks my shake
Want to impress me?
Don't interest me, with your talk
'Cause happiness is a loaded gun
I want everything, baby
You know what I like. (You know what I like)
I want you in my bed, all right
Can't sleep without my fix tonight
It's not polite or lady like
Do it right, do it right, do it right
Do me right, do me right, do me right
(Right)
By Lady Haha
I'm just an ordinary superstar
So far but always hanging where you are
I'm just an ordinary superstar
We’re just New York Girls!
(Verse 1 Madonna)
Girl on the screen, look at me
I never would have guessed that we'd be friends
Oh, but you don't want to be seen with me
I wanna see what you see
We're living in a world that's full of hate
Oh, but you don't care what they say
Do you?
(Chorus)
Down the subway, you looked my wayWith your girl gaze, with your girl gaze
That was the day everything changed
Couldn't stay the same
Now it's Tuesday and I'm thinking
'Bout to tuck in, 'bout to tuck in
Telling myself that it's cheating
But it's New York Girls
(Verse 2 Gaga)
New York Girls little let down, but I'm not dead
There's a little bit more that has to be said (oh, oh)You play me, now I play you too
Let's just call it over
(Chorus 2)
(Bridge Gaga, Madonna)
Scared to keep the lights on when I kiss you Slowly
Kissing you slowly
Does that mean that you're afraid to look at Real eyes baby
(Chorus 3, Ending)
NEW. YORK. GIRLS!
Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released
The hills are alive
With the sound of music
With songs they have sung
For a thousand years
The hills fill my heart
My heart wants to sing every song it hears
My heart wants to beat
Like the wings of the birds that rise
From the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray
I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely
I know I will hear
What I've heard bеfore
My heart will be blеssed
And I'll sing once more
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things
When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad
Edelweiss, Edelweiss
Bless my homeland forever
Climb ev'ry mountain
Ford ev'ry stream
Follow ev'ry rainbow
'Til you find your dream
A dream that will need
All the love you can give
Every day of your life
For as long as you live
(Spoken)
I'm not leaving without your vote tonight, you know that right?
(Sung)
I said, "Sit back down where you belong
Come on put your hands up. Are you ready? A one, two, three
Something, something about this place
You love this place don't you? Come on cheer for it
Something, something about my cool Pennsylvania guy
Yeah, there's something about, Joe, you and I
On my birthday you sang me Neil Young "Heart of Gold"
This time I’m not leaving without you, oh, oh, oh, oh
(spoken)
And you know I put on some country clothes the other day and said I was voting for Joe 'cause I wear cabellas when I'm on a four-wheeler in Pennsylvania. And I will not be told what I can and cannot wear to endorse our future president. So this is what I have to say about that. I might not always look like you, but I am you. We are each other
Sit back down where you belong
Sit back down where we belong, the whole damn country
The beautiful countryside
Something, ‘bout lonely nights
And my lipstick all over your face
Something, something about my cool Pensylvania guy
I'm not kidding, we need every single vote and Imma keep saying it
So put your hands up for Pensylvania
Pensylavania, Pensylavania, Pensylvania I love you
Hands up come on!
Baby, baby I'd rather die
America without you and I
And, you know, to my boyfriend that's here tonight, I'm so sorry I had to do the whole Pennsylvania and I dated a guy here thing. I love you so much. It's true
It's been a long time, but I'm back in town
And we're counting on you tomorrow, okay. And I know the good-hearted people here and my grandma and my whole family that's in West Virgina next door, okay I know, I know what this is. This is love
And this time I'm not leaving, this time I'm not leaving, I'm not leaving without
America I love you, I pray for you tomorrow. Let's win this. Pensylvania go blue!
Without you, woah
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin’ else you're searchin' for?
I’m fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
And I'd like to sing this to еverybody else ’causе you know what? No matter who wins tomorrow, we’re going to have to do this together. Tomorrow's gotta be peaceful
Tell me something, boy
Aren’t you tired tryna fill that void?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?
I'm falling
Scream real loud if you’re gonna vote tomorrow. Come on!
Do you know this one? Are you gonna sing it with me right here? Whos' off the deep end? Whos' of the deep end that Joe Biden needs to be president of this country? Are you ready, come on put your hands up. Ready? Let's sing it. 1, 2, 3, 4!
Go out and vote!
Let's pray real soon we're gonna be far from the shallow
Song Coming Soon
