So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
It couldn't be much more from the heart
I never opened myself this way
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
And I know, yeah-yeah!
No, nothing else matters
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh, God help me
Oh please God, help me
Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see, absolute horror
I cannot live, I cannot die
Trapped in myself, body my holding cell
Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech, taken my hearing
Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell
Say your prayers, little one, don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin
'Til the Sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land
Something's wrong, shut the light, heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragons' fire
And of things that will bite, yeah
Now, I lay me down to sleep (Now, I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep (Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
And if I die before I wake (If I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord my soul to take (Pray the Lord my soul to take)
Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed
In your closet, in your head
Grain of sand
We're off to never never-land (yeah, haha haha)
Oh, yeah-yeah, yo
End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me, you will see, more is all you need
Dedicated to how I'm killing you
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your...
Master! Master!
Master of Puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
(Master, master, master, master...)
Master! Master! Where’s the dreams that I’ve been after?
Master! Master! You promised only lies
Laughter! Laughter! All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter! Laughter! Laughing at my cries
Fix me!
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now, your life is out of season
I will occupy, I will help you die
I will run through you, now I rule you too
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
New blood joins this Earth and quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in this whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on
He's known, ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
They dedicate their lives to running all of his
He tries to please them all this bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win, a tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
That old man here is me, yeah
So I dub thee "Unforgiven," whoa
You labeled me, I'll label you
Ah, never free, never me
Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think... think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye...
Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fill his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see
Hey (Hey), I'm your life, I'm the one who takes you there
Hey (Hey), I'm your life, I'm the one who cares
They (They), they betray, I'm your only true friend now
They (They), they'll betray, I'm forever there
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true
I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true
You (You), you're my mask, you're my cover my shelter
You (You), you're my mask, you're the one who's blamed
Do (Do), do my work, do my dirty work, scapegoat
Do (Do), do my deeds for you're the one who's shamed
I'm your dream
I'm your eyes
I'm your pain
I'm your dream (I'm your dream)
I'm your eyes (I'm your eyes)
I'm your pain (I'm your pain)
Hate (Hate), I'm your hate, I'm your hate when you want love
Pay (Pay), pay the price, pay for nothing's fair
Hey (Hey), I'm your life, I'm the one who took you there
Hey (Hey), I'm your life and I no longer care
I'm your truth, telling lies
I'm your reasoned alibis
I'm inside, open your eyes
I'm you
Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says "rage"?
Sanitarium
Leave me be
Just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
I cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
(Just leave me alone)
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again
Slaves, Hebrews born to serve
To the Pharaoh
Heed to his every word
Live in fear
Faith of the unknown one
The deliverer
Wait, something must be done
Four hundred years
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Now, let my people go
Land of Goshen
Go, I will be with thee
Bush of fire
Blood, running red and strong
Down the Nile
Plague, darkness three days long
Hail to fire
Die, by my hand
(Die) I creep across the land
(Die) Killing first born man
I rule the midnight air
The destroyer
Born, I shall soon be there
Deadly mass
I creep the steps and floor
Final darkness
Blood, lamb's blood painted door
I shall pass
(And the road becomes my bride)
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need
And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Roamer, wanderer, nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will, yeah
Oh, but I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere, anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah
(And the Earth becomes my throne)
And the Earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one
And my ties are severed clean
The less I have the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will
Yeah you will
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I’ll never mind anywhere, anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah yeah
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my time anywhere, anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, that's right
Where I lay my head is home
Carved upon my stone
My body lies, but still, I roam yeah yeah
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam, roam
Wherever I may roam, yeah
Wherever I may wander, wander, wander!
Wherever I may roam, yeah yeah
Halls of justice painted green, money talking
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite they devour
Hammer of justice crushes you, overpower
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price
You pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real
Apathy their stepping stone, so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity, so deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns, hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds
Lady justice has been raped, truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips, now you're done in
Their money tips her scales again, make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell, cannot feel
We pay
Nothing can save us
Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery, battery
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery
Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth
Never her rebirth
Evolution's end
Never will it mend
Never
Fire, to begin whipping dance of the dead
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blistering of Earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore
Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened!

See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die
Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears
Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun
Fire is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity
Lay beside me, tell me what they've done
Speak the words I want to hear, to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me, then I can understand the you
Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining...
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah!
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, because I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?
Come lay beside me, this won't hurt I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
She lay beside me, But she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there...
Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
Yes, now I see it...
So sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there
Because I'm the one who waits, the one who waits for you, oh
(So I dub thee Unforgiven)
What I've felt...
Oh, what I've known...
I take this key (never free...)
And I bury it (never me...) in you
Because you're unforgiven too
Never free
Never me
Oh, oh, oh
Bitterness and burden
Curses rest on thee
Solitaire and sorrow
All eternity
Save the Earth and claim perfection
Deem the mass and blame rejection
Hold the pose, feign perception
Grudges break your back
All you bear
All you carry
Place it right on
Right on me
Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!
How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardized in ruin
What have you become?
Blame the world and blame your maker
Wish 'em to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on
Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down
Overload, the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and Heaven crumbles
All alone thy fears shall humble
Swallow all your pride
On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moaning out its one old song
You can think about the woman, or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
When you are riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
You don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through
But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
There I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page
So you walk into this restaurant, strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
And most times you can't hear them talk, other times you can
All the same old cliches: is it woman? Is it man?
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand, make your stand
Here I go, playing the star again
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try to give away
And the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers, ringing in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette, remembering what she said
What she said
There I go, turn that page
There I go, yeah, there I go, yeah
There I go, yeah, here I go
There I go, there I go
And I'm gone
Alright
We're scanning the scene in the city tonight
We're looking for you, to start up a fight
There's an evil feeling in our brains
But it's nothing new, you know it drives us insane
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy!
There is no escape and that's for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You've always been taking and now you're giving
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don't try running away, 'cause you're the one we will find
Searching, seek and destroy, a-ha ha ha ha
By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you've got some company
The horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
Aw yeah, yeah!
You've been dying since the day you were born
You know it's all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confession now
'Cause now you have got the fight of your life
Time! Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine! Your body, it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence! For what you've had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death! Deliverance for you for sure
Now there's nothing you can do
So gather round, young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now's the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgment hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat
Guilty as charged, but damn, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air, strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you?"
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Wait for the sign 
to flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold, as I watch death unfold
Consciousness, my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?
Someone help me
Oh please, God, help me!
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slow, the minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this? Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by a horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream
Born to push you 'round
Better just stay down
You pull away, he hits the flesh, you hit the ground
Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed, keep praying, just keep waiting
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes, ah
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no
No, the sunshine never comes
Push you cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself, crawl in yourself, you'll have your time
God, I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day, I'll splatter color on this gray
When you stand up and feel the warmth, huh
But the sunshine never comes
Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Here in this prison
I suffer this no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear, the sun will shine
This, I swear! This, I swear!
This! I! Swear!

Instrumental Intro

How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling
He could just be gone
He would just sail on
You would just sail on
How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Searched for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?
These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
This seeking life outside its hell
Inside intoxicating
He's run aground, like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast, down with the ship
Fading in the shadows
Now a castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me, why can't I forgive me?
So how can I blame you
Give me fuel, give me fire
Give me that which I desire, ooh!
Yeah
Turn on, I see red
Adrenaline crash and crack my head
Nitro junkie, paint me dead
And I see red
A hundred plus through black and white
War horse, warhead
Fuck 'em man, white-knuckle tight
Through black and white
Ooh, on I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And I burn, churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
So give me fuel, give me fire
Give me that which I desire
Hey!
Turn on beyond the bone
Swallow future, spit out home
Burn your face upon the chrome
Take the corner, join the crash
Headlights, headlines
Another Junkie lives too fast
Yeah lives way too fast, fast, fast, ooh
Give me that which I desire, ooh, yeah-heh
White knuckle tight!
Give me fuel (On I burn, on and on)
Give me fire (On I burn, on and on)
My desire (On I burn, on and on)
On I burn
In the name of desperation
In the name of wretched pain
In the name of all creation
Gone insane
We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
On the way to paranoia
On the crooked borderline
On the way to the great destroyer
Doomed design
Once upon a planet burning
Once upon a flame
Once upon a fear returning
All in vain
Do you feel that hope is fading?
Do you comprehend?
Do you feel it terminating?
In the end
Self-destruct
Bodies fill the fields I see,
 
hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be, a servant 'til I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son, but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greeting death, he's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
You will die when I say, you must die
You coward, you servant, you blind man
Barking of machine-gun fire, does nothing to me now
S
ounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you wear, glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see, the slaughter never ends
Why am I dying?
Kill! Have no fear
Lie! Live off lying
Hell! Hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend, alone, I clench my gun
Dear mother, dear father
What is this hell you have put me through?
Believer, deceiver
Day in, day out, lived my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator, dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired
Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly
Time has frozen still, what's left to be?
Hear nothing, say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
You clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled, unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do
I'm in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim, please rescue me
Hidden in your world you've made for me
I'm seething, I'm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew
My life suffocates, planting the seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate, trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take this life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
, you've turned this lie to truth
Anger, misery you'll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow (Language of the mad)
Harvester of sorrow
Pure black looking clear, my work is done soon here
Try getting back to me, get back which used to be
Drink up, shoot in, let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain, 
your loss becomes my gain
All have said their prayers, invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes, you'll find where murder lies
Infanticide
As I was going over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said stand and deliver or the devil, he may take you
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money, yeah, and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she would love me, no never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman, yeah, for you know she tricked me easy
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
Taking money with me but I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels, yeah
Yeah-ah, whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah
Now some men like the fishing and some men like the fowling
And some men like to hear, to hear cannon ball a roaring
Me? I like sleeping specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da, yeah, yeah
Whiskey in the jar-o, yeah
Hey, musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da, yeah
Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for Father, roaming free
Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches lurking beneath the sea
Great old one, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness, you dwell
Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death
Fearless wretch, insanity
Timeless sleep, has been upset
He awakens, hunter of the shadows is rising
In madness you dwell
Not dead, which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Blacked out
Pop queen, amphetamine
The screams crashed into silence
Tapped out
Doused in the gasoline
The high times going timeless
Decadence
Death of the innocence
The pathway starts to spiral
Infamy
All for publicity
Destruction going viral
Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, kill the truth
You’re falling, but you think you’re flying high
High again
Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you’re thrown away
Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
Twisted
Backstabbing wicked
The delusion absolution
Perjurer
Fame is the murderer
Seduce you into ruin
Ah, tell the truth
Burn!
Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself
The vultures feast around you still
Overdose on shame and insecurity
If one won’t do that fistful will
Death scene
Black hearse the limousine
A grave filled with seduction
Vaccine
Fame does the murdering
She builds up for destruction
So light it up
Ah, no excuse
Addicted to the fame
Saint Anger 'round my neck
He never gets respect
(You flush it out, you flush it out)
Fuck it all and no regrets, I hit the lights on these dark sets
I need a voice to let myself, to let myself go free
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets, I hit the lights on these dark sets
Medallion noose, I hang myself, Saint Anger 'round my neck
I feel my world shake like an earthquake
Hard to see clear, is it me, is it fear?
I'm madly in anger with you
And I want my anger to be healthy
And I want my anger just for me
And I need my anger not to control
And I want my anger to be me
And I need to set my anger free
Set it free!
Late at night, all systems go, you've come to see the show
We do our best, you're the rest, you make it real, you know
There's a feeling deep inside that drives you fucking mad
A feeling of a hammerhead, you need it, oh, so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!
Bang your head against the stage like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed, make it really sore
In a frenzied madness with your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around, it's hot as hell tonight
Here on stage, the Marshall noise is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face, exploding feeling nears
Now's the time to let it rip, to let it fucking loose
We're gathered here to maim and kill, cause this is what we choose
Here we go!
The show is through, the metal's gone, it's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig, again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways, life out here is raw
But we'll never stop, we'll never quit, 'cause we're Metallica
Whoa, whoa
When darkness falls, may it be
That we should see the light
When reaper calls, may it be
That we walk straight and right
When doubt returns, may it be
That faith shall permeate our scars
When we’re seduced, then may it be
That we not deviate our cause
All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
We can live forever
Verse 2]
When all is pain, may it be
It’s all we’ve ever known
When flame consumes, may it be
It warms our dying bones
When loss has won, may it be
It’s you I’m madly fighting for
When kingdom comes, may it be
We walk right through that open door
We can live, we can live forever
Return to ashes, shed this skin
Beyond the black, we rise again
We shall live forever
None
Don't tread on me
I said, "Don't tread on me"
Liberty or Death
What we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her
Rattling of her tail
Never begins it
Never, but once engaged
Never surrenders
Showing the fangs of rage
So be it
, threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it, settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore
Love it or leave it
She with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue
Forked as a lightning strike
Shining with brightness
Always on surveillance
The eyes, they never close
Emblem of vigilance
Ooh, no no no
Said, "Don't tread on me"
So be it, threaten no more
Where do I take this pain of mine
I run but it stays right by my side
So tear me open and pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps
Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now, it stays
So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean
It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me (yeah)
It hates you so hold me (yeah)
It holds you so hold me
Until it sleeps (Until it sleeps)
Until it sleeps
So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip, don't want your greed
Don't want it
I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me, until it sleeps
It stains you so hold me
It holds you
Holds you, holds you
Until it sleeps (Until it sleeps, until it sleeps)
I don't want it, I don't want it
Want it, want it, want it, want it, no, woah-woah
So wash me 'til I'm clean
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
Until it sleeps, until it sleeps
And it feels right this time
On this crash course with the big time
Pay no mind to the distant thunder
New day fills his head with wonder, boy
Says it feels right this time
Turned around and found the right line
Good day to be alive, Sir
Good day to be alive, he said, yeah
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Was just a freight train coming your way
Was just the freight train coming your way,
 yeah
Don’t it feel right like this?
All the pieces fall to his wish
Sucker for that quick reward, boy
Sucker for that quick reward, they said
Was just a freight train coming your way, yeah
It's coming your way
Here it comes
Yeah, then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Then it comes to be, yeah
1, 2
1, 2, 3, 4, 1
Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please, spreading his disease
Living by his story
Knees, knees, falling to your knees
Suffer for his glory, you will
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get a better seat
Bow to leper messiah
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain, join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame, infection is the game
Stinking drunk with power, we see
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie!
Wish I may
Wish I might
Have this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold
Dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?
All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased
Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle crumbled
And you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Where's your crown
Hot and cold
Bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold yeah
You wish your life away
Oh, nothing
Oh, where's your crown?
I wish I may
I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight
I want that star
I want it now
I want it all and I don't care how
Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
You may regret it
You just might get it
Nothing
No, you're just nothing
Absolutely nothing
Off to never never land
Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offense
You silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination
Keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward
Seems to me absurd
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both
The plus and negative
Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen
I see through the selfish lie
Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
You silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence
Lengthen freedom's ring
Freedom no longer frees you
Come unto me and you will feel perfection
Come unto me and dedicate
Come unto me, you'll never feel rejection
Come unto me and terminate
Remove your heart, it's only good for bleeding
Bleeding through your fragile skin
Remove your thought, 'cause it's only for deceiving
Deceiving thoughts destroy within
Disappear like man was never here
Long live machine
The future supreme
Man overthrown
Spit out the bone
Plug into me, I guarantee devotion
Plug into me and dedicate
Plug into me and I'll save you from emotion
Plug into me and terminate
Accelerate, Utopian solution
Finally cure the Earth of man
Exterminate, speeding up the evolution
Set on course a master plan
Reinvent the earth inhabitant
The flesh betrays the flesh
Your man has had his time
We lay him down to rest
Machined the new divine
Stop breathing and dedicate to me
Stop dreaming and terminate for me
All meaning you dedicate to me
All feelings you terminate for me
Our future supreme
Your man overthrown
Spit out the bone, yeah
Mama she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
"Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore it's done"
"The brightest flame burns quickest"
Is what I heard her say
A son's heart's owned to Mother
But I must find my way
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still (be still)
"Rebel," my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done
Or, let this heart be still
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still
Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
But a mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me, yeah-yeah
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see
You never let my heart go
So, let this heart be still
Obey, obey
Come won't you stay
Sincere, sincere
All ends in tears
Endure, endure
Thoughts most impure
Concede, concede
But both shall we bleed
Oh, Halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell
I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Turn out the light
Halo on fire
Allure, allure
Sweetness obscure
Abide, abide
Secrets inside
Deprive, deprive
To feel so alive
Just don't turn away
Prayers cannot get through
Return to sender
Unto which of you
Shall I surrender
Twisting in disguise
Dark resurrection
Lighting up the skies
Wicked perfection
Too dark to sleep
Can't slip away
Open or close
My eyes betray
Beyond the black
Hello darkness, say goodbye
Mama, they try and break me
The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms, no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?
Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Did you hear your babies crying?
Still they try and break me
Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now, deservingly, this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair
Don't want your aid
But the fist I make
For years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel
But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?
Did you feel your names?
So build a wall, behind it crawl
So can't you hear your babies crying now?
 x2
Mama, they try
Mama, they try...
Do unto others as they've done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Bursting with fear
We all shall die
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past
Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire!
Fight!
Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's going to give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
(Damage Incorporated)
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life isn't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall
We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
GO!
Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me going
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
But the memory remains
Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave
See the nowhere crowd, cry the nowhere tears of honor
Like twisted vines that grow
Hide and swallow mansions whole
Dim the light of an already faded primadonna
Heavy rings hold cigarettes
Up to lips that time forgets
While the Hollywood sun sets behind your back
And can't the band play on?
Just listen, they play my song
Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Fade to black
[Chorus (
Marianne Faithfull
)]
Dance little tin goddess
Drift away
Fade away
Little tin goddess
Ash to ash (ash to ash)
Dust to dust (dust to dust)
Fade to black (fade to black)
The memory remains
To this faded primadonna, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Solo (
Dance little tin goddess dance
Da da da da da da da, da da da da da
(Say yes... or at least say hello (la da da....)
Say yes... or at least say hello (la da da....))
(
Da da da
)
Da da da da
Da da
Na da da da da
La da da da
Da da da da (Say yes)
Da da da (Or at least say hello)
Da da da da da
My mother was a witch, she was burned alive
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Got to see them make them pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time
Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am
As I watched my mother die, I lost my head
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread
Taking no chances, you come with me
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free
On with the action now, I'll strip your pride
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you writhe
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat
Like a double dozen before you, smells so sweet
I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire
You can come with me, sweet desire
My face is long forgot, my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore, take me home
My soul is longing for, await my heir
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself
Am I evil? Yes I fuckin' am
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am, yeah...
Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eyes' disgrace
Defying commonplace
Unending paper chase
Unending
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you (Shortest straw)
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
You're living Catch-22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal
Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
(Shortest straw)
Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You're reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie Is crystal clear
Defending
Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead
Pulled for you
Pride you took, pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel
Not the word, not the love
Not what you thought from above
It feeds, it grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit, deceive
Decide just what you believe
I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed
Find your peace, find your say
Find the smooth road in your way
Trust you gave, a child to save
Left you cold and him in grave
Follow the god that failed, yeah
Betrayal, yeah
Oh wee oh, wee ohh
Never hunger, never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
, 
triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me
Birth of terror, death of much more
I'm the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings, spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear, they pull me under
Into ruin, I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free, flooded I'll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression
Myself is after me
Ah ha ha ha
You just stood there screaming
Fearing no one was listening to you
They say the empty can rattles the most
The sound of your own voice must soothe you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard
You, you're smothered in tragedy
And you're out to save the world
Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery
You still stood there screaming
No one caring about these words you tell
My friend before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
But something's wrong with all you see
You, you'll take it on all yourself
Remember, misery loves company
So fucking what?
Well, I have been to Hastings and I have been to Brighton
I have been to Eastbourne too
So what? So what?
And I have been here, I have been there
I have been every fucking where
So what? So what, you boring little cunt?
Well, who cares, who cares what you do?
Yeah, who cares, who cares about you?
You, you, you, you
Well, I fucked a queen, I fucked Bach
I have even sucked an old man's cock
And I fucked a sheep, I fucked a goat
I rammed my cock right down its throat
So what? So what, you boring little fuck?
And I have drunk that, I have drunk this
I have spewed up on a pint of piss
I have had skank,
I have had speed
I have jacked up until I bleed
You, you, you, you, hey
I have had crabs, I have had lice
I have had the clap and that ain't nice
I fucked this, I fucked that
I have even fucked a school girl's twat
You, you, you, you, you
So fucking what?! Yeah!
Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own to live my own way
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now, 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so called standards
Who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight
See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
Freezing, (freezing) can't move at all
Screaming, (screaming) can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, I'm trapped under ice
Crystallized as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep, I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say
Scream from my soul
Fate, mystified
Hell, forever more
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me
Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt, therefore I am
Harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lamb
We shift, pulsing with the Earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleep
Shapeshift, nose to the wind
Shapeshift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
(Back to the meaning)
Back to the meaning of life
Bright is the moon high in starlight
Chill is the air cold as steel tonight
We shift, call of the wild
Fear in your eyes
It's later than you realized
I feel a change, back to a better day
(Shapeshift) Hair stands on the back of my neck
(Shapeshift) 
In wildness is the preservation of the world
So seek the wolf in thyself
Shapeshift, feeling I have been
Move swift all senses clean
Back to the meaning
Of wolf and man
I'm digging my way
I'm digging my way to something
I'm digging my way to something better
I'm pushing to stay, yes
I'm pushing to stay with something
I'm pushing to stay with something better
Woah, woah oh, yeah
Woah oh oh, yeah, oh yeah
I'm sowing the seeds, yes
I'm sowing the seeds I've taken
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted
This thorn in my side
Yes, this thorn in my side is from the tree
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted
Oh, it tears me and I bleed, yeah
And I bleed, oh yeah, oh yeah
Caught under wheel's roll
I take the leech I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me, whoa
I can't take it
Caught under wheel's roll, whoa
The bleeding of me, yeah
Yes, of me
The bleeding of me
I'm bleeding me, woah-oh
Caught under wheel's roll, oh
Woah, oh
I am the beast that feeds the feast
I am the blood, I am release
Come make me pure
Bleed me a cure
I'm caught, I'm caught, I'm caught under
I can't stop to save my soul
I'm bleeding me, oh
I can't take it, I can't take it, I can't take it
Oh, the bleeding of me, yeah
I'm bleeding me, yeah
I'm digging my way, yeah
I'm digging my way to something better, yeah
I'm pushing to stay, hey
Yes, I'm pushing to stay with something
I'm pushing to stay with something better, yeah
With something better
One, Two
Luck. Runs. Out
Crawl from the wreckage one more time
Horrific memory twists the mind
Dark, rutted, cold and hard to turn
Path of destruction feel & burn
Still life, incarnation?
Still life, infamy?
Hallucination, heresy
Still you run, what's to come, what's to be
'Cause we hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck runs out
You crawl back in
But your luck runs out
The light that is not light is here
To flush you out with your own fear
You hide, you hide but will be found
Release your grip without a sound
Still life, immolation?
Still you run, what's to come? What's to be?
Then you crawl back in
Into your obsession
Never do return
This is your confession
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Your luck runs out
He sleeps under black seas waiting
Lies dreaming in death
He sleeps under cosmos shaking
Stars granting his breath
He wakes as the world dies screaming
All horrors arrive
He wakes giving Earth its bleeding
Pure madness alive
And He haunts you
And He blinds your soul
And He loathes you
And reclaims it all
You turn to stone
Can't look away
Madness, they say
Cthulhu awaken
He sways in abyss returning
Inhaling black skies
He shakes with a torture burning
All lost in his eyes
Sanity taken
Seething damnation
(Wake) Winged Salvation
Death by creation
Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Dreaming no more
No life ‘til leather
We're gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming it's right
Well alright, yeah
When we start to rock
We never wanna stop again
Hit the lights!
You know our fans are insane
We're gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today
The only way, yeah
With all-out screaming
We're gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain
Oh sweet pain, yeah
And now I wait my whole lifetime for you
I ride the dirt, I ride the tide for you
I search the outside, search inside for you
To take back what you left me
I know I'll always burn to be
The one who seeks so I may find
And now I wait my whole lifetime
I'm Outlaw torn
And I'm torn
So on I wait my whole lifetime for you
The more I search, the more my need for you
The more I bless, the more I bleed for you
You make me smash the clock and feel
I'd rather die behind the wheel
Time was never on my side
So on I wait my whole lifetime
Hear me, and if I close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
See me, and if my face becomes sincere
Beware
Hold me, and when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
Save me, and when you see me strut
Remind me of what left this outlaw torn
Living and dying, laughing and crying
Once you have seen it, you'll never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy, dirty and mean
Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away
Don't stop for nothing, it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine
Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life's about
You only live once, so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others, the same song and dance
Little grave I'm grieving, I will mend you
Sweet revenge I'm dreaming, I will end you
I've been here since dawn of time
Countless hatreds built my shrine
I was born in anger's flame
He was Abel, I was Cain
I am here
I'm hell unbound
Burn your kingdom to the ground
To the ground
Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, it's killing me
Revenge, set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge
I return this nightmare, I will find you
Sleepless, cloaked in despair, I'm behind you
Man has made me oh so strong
Blurring lines of right and wrong
Far too late for frail amends
Now it's come to sweet revenge
Desperate hands
That lose control
Have no mercy on your soul
On your soul
Revenge, is killing me
Sweet revenge
One crown
Shines on through the sound
Born to lose
One man
Does not give a damn
No excuse
Aces wild
Aces high
All the aces
Aces 'til you die
White lines fading
The iron horse rolls on and on and on
Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Living to win
One fist
Hammers through the mist
Steady on
One heart
Diehard from the start
Beats its song
Murder all
Murder one
Give me murder
Second class to none
Headlights fading
I still hear your thunder
'Til the end
Been living to win
All that is, was and will be
Universe, much too big to see
Time and space, never ending
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending
Limitations of human understanding
Too quick to criticize
Obligation to survive
We hunger to be alive, yeah
(Twisting, turning through the never)
All that is, ever, ever was
Will be ever, twisting, turning
Through the never
In the dark, see past our eyes
Pursuit of truth no matter where it lies
Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
On a quest, meaning, reason
Came to be, how it begun
All alone in the family of the sun
Curiosity teasing everyone
On our home, third stone from the sun, yeah
On through the never
We must go
Out to the
Edge of forever
Then ever comes
Who we are, ask forever
Twisting, turning through the never
Ooooh
Run away, the past will bite again
No matter where you dwell
You
Here again, a captive of the howl
Welcome back to hell
Faithful, as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the Beast are colliding
Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks anger's reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change
Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
I don't recognize you anymore
Tooth is fang, twisting under skin
Foul tongue, black breath
Change
Snap inside, the Beast about complete
Soon infects the rest
Howling at the door
Anymore
Inheritance, the past has bit again
The next heir of anarchy
Feel
Stretching skin so far beyond belief
I feel
The ever changing, you, in me
Howling evermore
I don't recognize me anymore
Anymore, ha ha ha
Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the Earth
To join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it's time for your fate and I won't hesitate
To pull you down into this pit
So come on
Jump in the fire
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
And from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now, my child, not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say
Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I'm stalking you as prey
Living your life with me, I am you, you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand, walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong
Come on, jump in now!
If I could have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?
Stop to warm at Karma's burning
Or look ahead, but keep on turning?
Do I have the strength to know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside to deal with what I shouldn't know?
Could I have my wasted days back
You live it or lie it, you live it or lie it
(You live it or lie it, you live it or lie it)
My lifestyle determines my death style
Keep searching, keep on searching
This search goes on, this search goes on
Frantic, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick tock
I've worn out always being afraid
An endless stream of fear that I've made
Treading water full of worry
This frantic tick, tick talk of hurry
Worn out always being afraid
Keep searching, yeah, I keep on searching
This search goes on, on and on
Oh, my lifestyle determines my death style 
(Birth is pain)
A rising tide that pushes to the other side
(Life is pain)
My lifestyle determines my death style 
(Death is pain)
A rising tide that pushes to the other side 
(It's all the same)
Chaos
Awaiting for Adam's return
Madness
Smiling, as we watch it burn
I've become
Hostage to my mind
Left myself behind
Blind lead blind
Quest to find
Faith in man(un)kind
Garden
Of Eden, so simple and pure
Greedy
Needy, must we have more?
Fascinate
Partner of insanity
Decimate
Lessons we never learn
Dominate
Killing of the innocence
Deviate
And to dust you return
Seized by the day
Frozen captive by the night
All the dark days of your life
Led so astray
Zero
Reset, creation of man
Foolish
Ready, to witness again?
Oh, Faith in man(un)kind
Like a siren in my head that always threatens to repeat
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face that learned to speak, when all it knew was how to bite
Like a misery that keeps me focused though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day
Like conviction, a premonition not worthy of, so I deny, I deny
I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye
Almost like your life, almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long, realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow, never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight, and there it went almost like your life
Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river, drowning when I only need a drink
Like a poison that I swallow, but I want the world to die
Like a release from a prison that I didn't know I was in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed to leave from way back then
Like a general without a mission until the war would start again
Start again
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a strike from heaven that turns that key
That brings you straight down to your knees
That it can get if I get caught
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve
That was just your life
No mercy for what we're doing
No thought to even what we've done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
Blood feeds the war machine
As it eats its way across the land
No remorse is the one command
Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We're ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face
Attack!
Bullets are flying, people are dying
With madness surrounding, all Hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding, bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going, blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting, swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening, you know death is near
No remorse
Wake to face the day
Grab this life and walk away
War is never done
Rub the patch and battle on
Make it go away
Please, make it go away
Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life, the war that never ends
Leave the battlefield
Yet its horrors never heal
Coming home from war
Pieces don't fit anymore
Father, please come home
Shell shocked all I've known
Label him a deadwood soldier now
Cast away and left to roam
Rapid is the road to sacrifice
Just takes longer to come home
Come home
Crossfire ricochets inside me
Trapped in a memory forever
My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins
There's a dog at your back step
He must come in from the rain
I fall cause I let go
The net below has rot away
So my eyes seek reality
And my fingers seek my veins
The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bare to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn
So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due
Please forgive me
My fingers feel for faith
Touch clean with a dirty hand
I touched the clean to the waste
So low the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again
And I cry, to the alley way
Confess all to the rain
But I lie, lie straight to the mirror
The one I've broken, to match my face
Outta my way, outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine
Into no one, into not one
Into your step but out of time
Headstrong, what's wrong?
I've already heard this song before
You've arrived
But now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye
Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless
It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch, ah!
Yeah, it ain't my bitch
Down on the sun, down and no fun
Down and out where the hell ya been?
Damn it all down, damn it unbound
Damn it all down to hell again
Stand tall, can't fall
Never even bend at all before
Oh, outta my way!
(And now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye)
(And now it's time to kiss ass)
No way but down
Why you're around?
No foolin'
It ain't my smile
It ain't my style
It ain't my bitch, oh, it ain't mine
Ain't mine, your kind
You're steppin' out of time
It ain't my, ooh, bitch
You ain't mine
There is a devil waiting outside your door (How much longer?)
And he is bucking and braying and pawing at the floor (How much longer?)
And he is howling with pain, crawling up the walls (How much longer?)

With a trembling heart, he is coming through your door (How much longer?)
With his straining sex in his jumping paw (How much longer?)
And he's old and he's stupid and he's hungry and he's sore
And he is blind and he's lame and he is dirty and he's poor

Loverman

The crap rolls out of your mouth again
Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatin
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about your self instead?
Who are you? Where you been? Where you from?
Gossip burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much, you believe yourself
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself
Holier than thou
You are
You know not
Before you judge me, take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do?
Point the finger, slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand
It's not who you are, it's who you know
Others' lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges and build them back with wealth
Yeah! Who the hell are you?!
Not!
(All within my hands)
All within my hands
Squeeze it in, crush it down
Hold it dear, hold it suffocate
Love to death, smack you around and around and
Love is control, I'll die if I let go
Hate me now
Kill all within my hands
Crush all within my hands
Squeeze all within my hands
Choke all within my hands
Trap all within my hands
Hurry up and hate me now
Kill all within my hands again
Take your fear, pump me up
Let you run, then I pull your leash
All within my
(Hands)
Under thumb, under to myself
Love is control, I'll die if I let go (let it go)
I'll die if I let go
Control is love, love is control
I'll fall if I let go
I will only let you breath
My air that you receive
Then we'll see if I let you love me
Love is control
Crush all within my hands again (yeah, yeah)
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill, kill, kill
Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin
Open my eyes just to have them close again
Well on my way, but on my way to where I've been
It swallows me as it takes me in its fog
I twist away as I give this world the nod
Open my eyes just to have them closed once again
Don't want control, ay-yeah
As it takes me down, and down, and down again
Is that the moon or just a light that lights this dead-end street?
Is that you there or just another demon that I meet?
The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Step into the house that Jack built
´Cause this is the house that Jack built
Open door, yes, I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take the sin
Let the show begin (Let the show begin)
And the higher you are
'Cause I am, I am, I am
Open my eyes
It swallows me
Is that you there
I twist away
Away
Hey, hey, hey, here I go now
Here I go into new days
I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Yeah, hey, hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey, no mercy
Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear
Hey, hey, hey, and I went
And I went on down that road
Hey, hey, hey, and I went on
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, and I went on
(I'm gone! I'm gone!
I'm gone! I'm real gone!)
(I'm gone! I'm gone, baby!
I'm gone! I'm gone!)
(Disappear)
Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Bodies waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips
Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall on to your knees for the phantom lord
Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fist of terrors breaking through
Hear the cry of war louder than before
The leathered armies have prevailed
The phantom lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound
Fall to your knees
And bow to the phantom lord!
Thunder and lightning, the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
Oh, through the mist and the madness
We're trying to get the message to you
Metal militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
Nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
Iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metalization of your inner soul
Twisting and turning
Metal militia, oh!
We are as one as we all are the same
Fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
Protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
With our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go
Good day, how do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Ain't gonna waste my hate
Ain't gonna waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it for myself
Ain't gonna give no more
Ain't got the time to help you score
I think it's time you pleased yourself
Yourself
Waste my hate on you
Hate
You think you're worthy now?
You think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two-pronged crown?
Well I see my hands, I see my feet
I feel that blood that pumps in beat
But where the hell's my mind going now?
Dead gone now
I think I'll keep it for myself, hey!
But I'm so greedy when they say
Better to give than to receive
Ain't gonna waste my hate, no, no
Ain't got time to waste my hate on you
Yeah, I think I'm going to keep it all for myself
For myself
I think I'll keep it for myself, yeah!
Sleep, and dream of this
Death angel's kiss
Brings final bliss
Come believe me
Empty they say
Death, won't you let me stay
Death, hear me call your name
Oh, call your name
Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore
Wait, wait patiently
Your death-black wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading o'er me
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Say, is that rain or are they tears
That stained your concrete face for years?
The crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after life
An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel laid right down
Upon the grave which swallows fast
It's peace at last
O peace at last
Call your name
Forevermore
(Been here before)
Been here before, couldn't say I liked it
But do I start writing all this down?
Just let me plug you into my world
Can't you help me be uncrazy?
Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if I could I'd turn my eyes
To look inside to see what's coming
It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive
And I die a little more
Each moment here I die a little more
Ooh, I die, I die, I die
A little more
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Takes me away
I'm frantic in your soothing arms
I can not sleep in this down filled world
Found safety in this loneliness
But I can not stand it anymore
Cross my heart, hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room
You fool, you fool, it will be here soon
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
It takes me away, it takes me
It comes alive, yeah yeah
Takes me away, yeah it takes me away
Get the fuck out of here
I just want to get the fuck away from me
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I hate it all, why? Why? Why me?
I cannot sleep with a head like this
I want to cry, I want to scream
I want to hate it all away
Then I wait for this train
My toes are over the line
Takes me away, yeah, it takes me away
Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real
Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showing your gratitude
So many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose
(What the hell?) What the hell?
What is that you think you're gonna find?
(Hypocrite) Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind
(Struggle within) It suits you fine
(Struggle within) Your ruin
(Struggle within) You seal your own coffin
(Struggle within) The struggling within
Home is not a home it becomes a hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your hell
(Reaching out) Reaching out
Grabbing for something you have got to feel
(Closing in) Closing in
The pressure upon you is so unreal
Struggle
What the hell?
Hypocrite
Yeah, I feel you too
Feel, those things you do
In your eyes I see a fire that burns
To free the you
That's wanting through
Deep inside you know
Seeds I plant will grow
One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah come on, come on now take the chance
That's right
Let's dance
Snake, I am the snake
Tempting, that bite you take
Let me make your mind
Leave yourself behind
Be not afraid
I've got what you need
Hunger I will feed
Haha, come dance
Yeah, come dancing
That's running through
Lets dance
It's nice to see you here, haha!
Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
One for each of us and our sins
So you lay us in a line
Push your pins they make us humble
Only you can tell in time
If we fall or merely stumble
But tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?
Tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine
And I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in me
Mirror, mirror upon the wall
Break the spell or become the doll
See you sharpening the pins
So the holes will remind us
We're just the toys in the hands of another
And in time, the needles turn from shine to rust
Jab that
Here come the pins
Blood for face, sweat for dirt
Three X's for the stone
To break this curse. a ritual's due
I believe I'm not alone
Shell of shotgun, 
pint of gin
Numb us up to shield the pins
Renew our faith
Which way we can
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love
So tell me, can you heal what father's done?
No more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more, no more
No, no, no
Bass solo, Take 1
These are the eyes that can't see me
These are the hands that drop your trust
These are the boots that kick you around
This is the tongue that speaks on the inside
These are the ears that ring with hate
This is the face that I'll never change
This is the fist that grinds you down
This is the voice of silence no more
These are the legs in circles run
This is the beating you'll never know
These are the lips that taste no freedom
This is the feel that's not so safe
This is the face you'll never change
This is the god that ain't so pure
This is the god that is that pure
We the people
Are we the people?
Some kind of monster
This monster lives
This is the face that stones you cold
This is the moment that needs to breathe
These are the claws that scratch these wounds
This is the pain that never leaves
This is the tongue that whips you down
This is the burden of every man
These are the screams that pierce your skin
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This is the test of flesh and soul
This is the trap that smells so good
This is the flood that drains these eyes
These are the looks that chill to the bone
These are the fears that swing over head
These are the weights that hold you down
This is the end that will never end
This is the cloud that swallows trust
This is the black that uncolors us
This is the face that you hide from
This is the mask that comes undone
Ominous
I'm in us
You rise, you fall, you’re down and you rise again
What don't kill you, make you more strong
Rise, fall down, rise again
Through black days, through black nights
Through pitch black insides
Breaking your teeth on the hard life coming
Show your scars
Cutting your feet on the hard earth running
Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
But we die hard
The dawn, the death, the fight to the final breath
Dawn, death, fight, final breath
They scratch me, they scrape me
They cut and rape me
Bleeding your soul in a hard luck story
Spilling your blood in the hot sun's glory
We die hard
Ah
Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Just shut your pretty eyes
I will be seeing you again
I will be seeing you, in hell
So don't cry to me oh baby
Your future is in an oblong box
Don't cry to me oh baby
You should have seen it coming on
Had to know it was in your card
Dead-end soul for a dead-end girl
And now your life drains on the floor
Just shut your pretty mouth
Die-die-die
Die
Sight
Pale riders into the night
Galloping harder and faster
Through your dreaming
Wake
Walk towards the fire innate
Frost bitten soul below zero
Excitation
Are you remembering the sound?
Recall the shaking of the ground?
Pounding
Lords of summer, set on course
Pushing
Horsemen ride
Lords of summer, undenied
At last the thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
So celebrate and let your fires burn
The lords of summer have returned
Straight
Light passes through, penetrate
It's been a long, lonely winter
Illumination
Bright
Bathe in the volume and light
Reanimated by fire
Transformation
Become the nexus of the sound
Become the shaking of the ground
Whoa, pounding
Lords of summer set on course
Whoa, pushing
The lords of summer undenied, undenied
Need more and more, tainted misery
Bleed, battle scars, chemical affinity
Reign, legacy, innocence corrode
Stain, rot away, catatonic overload
Choke, asphyxia, snuff reality
Scorch, kill the light, incinerate celebrity
Reaper, butchery, karma amputee
Bloodline, breeding fine, death contagious deity
Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
New consequence machine
Burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime, nevermind
You've reached the end of the line
The end of the line
Time, choke the clock, steal another day
Die faithfully, narcissistic fade away
Twisted, jump the rail, shout at the crowd below
Breaker, chase the ghost, the latest high to all time low
Drop the hourglass of time
Spilling sand we will not find
As we gather here today
We bid farewell, the slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master, yeah
Right now, and ever after
Asylum overtime, never mind
Dead hour-glass of time, sand we will not ever find
We gather here today, say goodbye
Cause you've reached the end of the line
I got somethin' to say
I killed your baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead
I raped your mother today
As long as she's spread
Ooh, lovely death is waitin' for your breath
Come, sweet death, one last caress
Last caress, sweet death
Yo
Here in this place lies the key to your death
Touch it, see it
Here in this place is the means to your end
Touch it, feel it, green hell
You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from me
I bet you thought you really could
We are going to burn in hell - Green hell
Like every hell but kind of green - Green hell
Try let me get back up there - Green hell
Feel it burning in your cereal - Green hell
Throw your fucking friends inside - Green hell
Got to fucking pay and you must stay - Green hell
Cannot refill the torch of death - Green hell
Hell is reigning in your blood - Green hell
Got to burn it all, green hell
You have come to this as someone told
Going to bring green hell
Green hell
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I'm going to make you, shake you, take you
I'm going to be the one who breaks you
Put the screws into you, yeah, my way
Yeah, come on, come on, come and make my day
Make my day
Yeah, got some hell to pay you, I steal your thunder
The joy of violent movement pulls you under
Ooh, bite the bullet, well, hard
Yeah but I bite harder, so go too far, too far
(Friction, fusion, retribution)
(Friction, fusion)
I can't hear you, talk to me
(Retribution)
I can't hear you, so, talk to me
I can't hear you, are you talking to me?
Can't hear you, time to meet my Lord
I can't hear you, talk to 2 X 4, hey
Yeah, I'm going to make you, shake you, take you
Oh, I can't hear you, are you talking to me?
Talk to two by four
It don't take no more
Don't you leave me, Father time
Take me with you
Tell me, does your sun still shine?
Come squeeze the world and drip it down my throat again
Down my throat again... whoa
You got to breathe, man, breathe
Coming up for air
Breathe, man, breathe
Touch me so I think I'm here
Skin my senses
Barely breathing
Minus Human
Please squeeze the world and drip it down my throat again
Ooo, down my throat again... whoa
Coming up for - yeah
Clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madmans face
His reason tends to fly away
Like lesser birds on the four winds, yeah
Like silver scrapes in May
And now the sand has become a crust
Most of you have gone away (yeah, gone away)
Come Susie dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you will soon be married
And you will want to know where winds come from
Well it is never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the Four Winds Bar
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Four winds at the Four Winds Bar
Two doors locked and windows barred
One door left to take you in
The other one just mirrors it
Hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The Queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes the light that never, never warms
Yes the light that never
Never warms, never warms, never warms
The clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst
Miss Carrie nurse and Susie dear
Would find themselves at Four Winds Bar
It's the nexus of the crisis
And the origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me
Call me Desdinova
Eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
And don't forget my dog
Fixed and consequent
Astronomy, a star
Astronomy
When the world has turned its back
When the days have turned pitch black
When the fear abducts your tongue
When the fire's dead and gone
So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done
When you are the ostracized
Selfish ridden dead goodbyes
Twisting of the tourniquet
When the pieces never fit
Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss
When the storm has blacked your sky
Intuition crucify
When the ego strips your reign
Assassinate the living flame
Venom of a life insane
Bites into your fragile veins
Internalize and decimate
Patronize and complicate
Submit Infectiously
Judas lives recite this vow
I've become your new god now
Followed you from dawn of time
Whisper thoughts into your mind
Watched your towers hit the ground
Lured the children never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown
In the heart of feeble man
Plant the seeds of my own plan
The strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all
Inside you all
Ah Judas
Breadfan, open up your mind, open up your purse
Open up your bones, never, never gonna lose it
Breadfan, take it all away, never give an inch
Got to make a mint, got to make me a million
Breadfan, you got it wrong, some long time friend's
Going to lose it in the end, who is a fool
Seagull, give it all away, stay a bird, stay a man
Stay a ghost, stay what you want to be
Loser, give it all away, never stay with the winner
With the man with all the filthy money
Come on, keep it on the side, with a ride on a record
On the top if you're gonna be a bad boy
Open up your bones, never, never going to lose it
Mommy, where's fluffy?
Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Hard explosive
Reach in, pull that pin
Feel thy name, extermination
Desecrate, inhale the fire
So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse
Deadly vision
Prophecy reveal
Death magnetic
Pulling closer still
Fear thy name, annihilation
Desolate, inhale the fire
My apocalypse
Go
Crushing metal, ripping skin
Tossing body mannequin
Spilling blood, bleeding gas
Mangle flesh, snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shattered face, spitting glass
Split apart
Split
Spit it out!
What makes me drift a little bit closer?
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over?
Worn to repeat until I feel
See through the skin the bones they all rattle
Future and past they disagree
Flesh falls away the bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me
See the end in me
Climb out of this skin
Violate, annihilate
Wounds unto my eyes
Obliterate, exterminate
Life itself denied
Fear thy name as hell awakens
Destiny, inhale the fire
But we've crossed that line
Tyrant awaken my apocalypse
Demon awaken my apocalypse
Heaven awaken my apocalypse
Suffer forever my apocalypse
Story starts, quiet town
Small town boy, big time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way
Then streets of red, red, I'm afraid
There's no confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But, oh my God, how it all did change
Now, they all pray
"Bloodstain, wash away"
He said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"
I heard it
Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today
I always said something's wrong
With little, strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smiled
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles
"Gallows calls, son," I say
Keep your smile and laugh all day
Think once again in this boring place
For little boys, how they soon change
And they all pray
"I lost my way
I lost my way"
Yeah, well all the green things died
When Ronnie moved to this place
He said, don’t you dare ask
Why I'm cursed to wear this face
Now we all know why
Children called him Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket
And they'd all fall down, down, down
Lost my way
He screamed
(That's right)
All things wash away...
(And they'd all fall down)
But blood stained the sun today...
(Yeah, yeah)
Hit dirt
Shake tree
Split sky
Part sea
Strip smile
Lose cool
Bleed the day
And break the rule
Live win
Dare fail
Eat the dirt
And bite the nail
Then make me miss you
So wash your face away with dirt
It don't feel good until it hurts
So take this world and shake it
Come squeeze and suck the day
Come carpe diem, baby
Draw Lead
Piss wine
Sink teeth
All mine
Stoke fire
Break neck
Suffer through this
Cheat on death
Hug the curve
Lose the time
Tear the map
And shoot the sign
Yeah, Suck it!
Come make me miss you
Come carpe diem baby
Let us have peace, let us have life
Let us escape the cruel night
Let us have time, let the sun shine
Let us beware the deadly sign
The day is coming, Armageddon's near
Inferno's coming, can we survive the blitzkrieg
The blitzkrieg, the blitzkrieg
Save us from fate, save us from hate
Save ourselves before it's too late
Come to our need, hear our plea
Save ourselves before the earth bleeds
The Day is dawning, the time is near
Aliens calling, Can we survive the blitzkrieg
Burp
HAH HAH HAH!
(I fucked up, in one place)
Invisible kid
Never see what he did
Got stuck where he hid
Fallen through the grid
Got a place of his own
Where he'll never be known
Inward he's grown
Locked away in his brain
From the shame and the pain
World down the drain
Suspicious of your touch
Don't want no crutch
But it's all too much
I hide inside
I hurt inside
I hide inside, 
bull I'll show you
I'm OK, just go away
Into distance let me fade
I'm OK, 
but please don't stray too far
Open your heart
I'm beating right here
Open your mind
Right now
Ooh, what a good boy you are
Out of the way and you're kept to yourself
Ooh, can't you see that he's not here
He doesn't want the attention you give
Ooh, unplugging from it all
Invisible kid floats alone in his room
Ooh, what a quiet boy you are
He looks so calm floating 'round and around himself
Wash your back so you don't stab mine
Get in bed with your own kind
Live your life so you don't see mine
Drape your back so you won't shine
Oh, then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile
Using what I want to get what you want
Oh, sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
Chase the rabbit, fetch the stick
She rolls me over until I'm sick
She deals in habits, deals in pain
I run away but I'm back again
And I lie to get a smile, oh yeah
Then she squeezes tighter
I still lie to get a smile
She holds the pen that spells the end
She traces me and draws me in
Ooh, sweet Amber
It's never as sweet as it seems
So wake up, sleepy one
It's time to save your world
Steal dreams and give to you
Shoplift a thought or two
All children touch the sun
Burn fingers one by one, by one
Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?
You're where the wild things are
Yeah, toy soldiers off to war
Big eyes to open soon
Believing all under sun and moon
But does heaven know you're here?
And did they give you smiles or tears?
No, no tears
You swing your rattle down
(Hand puppets storm the base! Flags up now cannons rage! Hand puppets storm the base!)
Call to arms the trumpets sound
(Flags up now cannons rage! All clowns head for the rear! Slingshots fire to the air!)
Toy horses start the charge
(All clowns head for the rear! Slingshots fire to the air! Slip into the edge of death!)
Robots, chessmen standing guard
(Crossfire to the marionettes! Slip into the edge of death! Crossfire to the marionettes!)
We shall never surrender
Burn your fingers one by one
Keep you clean or stain through
So close your little eyes
If you're leaving, close the door
I'm not expecting people, anymore
Hear me grieving, lying on the floor
Whether drunk or dead, I really ain't too sure
I'm a blind man
And my world is pale
When a blind man cries
Lord, you know
There ain't a sadder tale
Had a friend once, in a room
Had a good time, but it ended much too soon
In a cold month, in that room
We found a reason, for the things we had to do
Now my room is cold
He feels it from his soul
They're walking by the night
The moon has frozen blue
Long black coats a shelter for the rain
Their load must get through
Now bats are leaving their trees
They're joining the call
Seven satanic Hell preachers
Heading for the hall
Bringing the blood of a newborn child yeah
Got to succeed, if not it's Satan's fall
Away out in Egypt in the valley of kings
Where the mummified pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep yeah
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you are in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you
The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly
Just destroying your future
Making it all shady
Listen, I am a corpse, I am a corpse
I am a corpse without soul
Satan, he is taken, he is taken
He is taken his toll
He took it on me
I, I am trapped, I am trapped
I am trapped in his spell
Tonight, I am going, I am going
I am going to Hell, inside his spell
Howl like a wolf
And a witch will open the door
Follow me and meet our high priestess
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child
Undress until you are naked
And put on this white coat
Take this white cross and go to the center of the ring
I was born in the cemetery
Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave by the dead
And I was made a mercenary
In the legions of Hell
Now I am king of pain, I'm insane
You know my only pleasure
Is to hear you cry
I'd love to hear you cry
I'd love to see you die
And I will be the first
To watch your funeral
And I will be the last to leave
I would love to hear you cry
And when you are down beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye (goodbye)
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
You got to say goodbye
Yeah. 'cause I will eat your mind!
There's a black cloud overhead, that's me
And the poison ivy chokes the tree, again it's me
I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street you walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes hard and makes it cry
There's a dirty needle in your child, stick me
Empty bottles still in hand, still dead, still me
I'm the suit and tie that bleeds the street and still wants more
I'm the forty-five that's in your mouth, I'm a dirty, dirty whore
Yeah, look, it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see
Hey, look, it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want to see
Hey, ma
Hey, ma! Look, it's me
And he wants to be called "father" now, me again, me
The marks inside your arms spell me, spell only me
I'm the nothing face that plants the bomb and strolls away
I'm the one who doesn't look quite right as children play
Look up to me
What to be and what to fear
Look, it's me. Like what you hear?
See right through me
See the one who can't be free
Look, it's me, what no one wants to see
(Hey, hey, hey)
Now see the black cloud up ahead (that's me)
And this poison ivy chokes the tree (again it's me)
And I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street you walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes, pushes, makes it cry
But too old to see, hey, hey
(See right through me)
(Look up to me)
I see my reflection in the window
It looks different, so different than what you see
Projecting judgement on the world
This house is clean baby, this house is clean
Am I who I think I am?
I look out my window and see it's gone wrong
Court is in session and I slam my gavel down
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
Projector, protector, rejector, infector
Projector, rejector, infector, injector, defector, effector
This window clean inside, dirty on the out
I'm looking different than me
Projector, rejector, infector, injector, defector, ejector, deflector
Projector, rejector, infector, injector, defector, ejector
I drink from the cup of denial
I'm judging the world from my throne
I'm judging the world from my throne, yeah
All roads they lead to shame
All drowning in the blame
All reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver
All hide beneath a skin
A hope so paper thin
I'm at the door again
And the shine of the midnight revolver
Even the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a 45
Suck on the barrel
Suck it until it's gone dry
For all reflections look the same
Redemption purify
Will nothing satisfy
The scars just multiply
Twisting in apocalypse
Death upon the fingertips
Frigid metal touches lips
Because you lied
Just a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leaving you
Stop the voices in my head
Caressing death again
Becomes the heroin
Forbidden medicine
Puts a shine on the midnight revolver
Eternal borderline
All the faces intertwine
Oh God... now I see mine
Down In Misery
I don't wanna go
Something tells me no
But traces in the sand
The lines that set my hand
Go, go, go
Beware of a place
A smile of a bright shining face
I'll never return, how do you know?
Tarot woman
I don't know
She can take you there
The entrance to the fair
Mine, mine, mine
Ride the carousel
And cast a magic spell
Fly, fly, fly
Tarot woman, I don't know
High noon, oh, I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years worth of breaking my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides, he's lighter than air
Oh, I see his face
Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
And when do we leave?
I believe, I believe, yes, I believe
In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many die
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
But we don't know why
Now, where do we go?
Danger, danger, the queen's about to kill
Stranger, stranger, and life's about to spill
Oh no, move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the wind
No pawn, be gone, speed on and on
Kill the king
Tear him down
Yeah, strike him down
Power, power it happens every day
Power, devour all along the way
And fly like the wind
Strike him down
Treason, treason, the spectre looms again
Treason, reason, the realm is safe and then
Fly like the rainbow
Yeah, tear him down
Yeah, take his crown
Oh, kill the king
Go take his crown
The man takes another bullet
He keeps them all within
He must seek, no matter how it hurts
So don't fool again
He thinks the answer is cold and in his hand
He takes his medicine
He's been fooled again
Uncross your arms and take
Take and throw them to the cure, say
"I do believe"
Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say
"I do believe", yeah
The lies tempt her and she follows
Again she lets him in
She must believe to fill the hollow
She's been fooled again
"I do believe", oh yeah
"I do believe", yeah-yeah, whoa
Betting on the cure
It must get better than this
Yeah, everyone's got to have the sickness
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure
Because it must get better than this
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure, aowah, yeah
I do believe I do believe I do believe
Need to feel secure
It's got to get better than this
Everyone's got to have the sickness
Imagine you were at my station
And you brought your motor to me
You're a burner, yeah a real motor car
Said you want to get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do you know, luckily for you
Who ever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank
Made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat
We were shifting hard when we took off
Put tonight all four on the floor
When we hit top end you know it feels too slow
Uh, you guys ready?
1, 2, 3
Train roll on, on down the line
Won't you please take me far, far away
Now, I feel the wind blow outside my door
Lord and, I'm leaving my woman at home
My baby's gone
Tuesday's gone with the wind, yeah
My baby's gone, gone with the wind
Gone, gone, Gary, yeah
Pepper
And I don't know where I am going
I just want to be left alone
When this train ends, well I'll try again
I'm leaving my woman at home
Tuesday's gone with the wind, oh yeah
Tuesday's gone, gone with the wind, yeah
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone, gone, gone with the wind, yeah
Train roll on, many miles from my home
See, I am riding my blues babe, my blues away, yeah, yeah
Well Tuesday, you see, oh, she had to be free, yeah
But somehow I've got to, to carry on
Tuesday's gone, gone, gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone
Ride on train
Train roll on, yeah
Train it rolls on
Lord I can't change
Ride on train, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can't change
Thanks Gary
Thanks Pop
Thanks Pep
Thanks Jerry
Thank you Het
Thanks Les
Thanks Fatso
Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone
Rumors going round, got to clear out of town
Smell like a dry fishbone
Here come the law, going to break down the door
Carry me away once more
Never, never, never want it anymore
Got to get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know
Rainy afternoon, ought to kill a typhoon
And she is playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet
Fully loaded Tommy gun
Here come the deputy, try fucking getting me
Gotta fucking get up and run
They got the sirens loose, I ran right out of juice
They are going to put me in a cell
If I can't go to heaven, let me go to hell
Look out at the darkness, and you will see
Just call my name and I'll be there
You cannot touch me, you would not dare
I am the chill that's in the air
And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the day
Dark rivers are flowing back into the past
You are the fish for which I cast
And what of the future, what is to be
As the rivers flow into the sea
Do not take for granted, powers out there
Don't step into the demon's lair
Time is an illusion, rising from time
Steep is the mountain which we climb
Forgive me, father
For I have sinned
Find me guilty of the life I feel within
When I'm branded
This mark of shame
Should I look down disgraced
Or straight ahead
And know that you must blame
I am (I am) the secret
I am (I am) the sin
I am (I am) the guilty
And I (And I)
I am the thorn within
Find me guilty when true guilt is from within
So point your fingers
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you
One and the same are we
I do your time
I take your fall
I'm branded guilty
For us all
I am (I am) the secrets
I won't go away
Right, Right here I'll stay
Stand silent in flames
Stand tall untill it fades
Shoot Me Again
I ain't dead yet
C'mon Shoot Me Again
I said Shoot Me Again
I ain’t dead yet
C’mon Shoot Me Again
Come on
 X2
Shoot Me
All these shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you
All the shots
All the shots I take
What difference did I make?
I won't go away (with a bullet in my back!)
Right, Right here I'll stay (with a bullet in my back!)
Shoot me (take a shot)
I'll stand on my own (with a bullet in my back!)
I'm stranded and sold (with a bullet in my back!)
Yeah Shoot Me Again
I said
All the shots I take (Hey!)
What difference did I make? (What difference did I make?)
I bite my tongue
Trying not to shoot back
No compromise
My heart won't pump the other way
Wake the sleeping giant
Wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog
No, Let him sleep
Bite my tongue
I spit back at you, yeah
Comes back to haunt you, oh
All the shots I take, hey
I spit back at you, oh
I look at you, then you me
Hungry and thirsty are we
Holding the lion's share
Holding the key
Holding me back because I'm striving to be
Better than you
Better than you 
Lock horns, I push and I strive
Some how I feel more alive
Bury the need for it
Bury the seed
Bury me deep when there's no will to be
Oh, can't stop this train from rolling
Oh, nothing brings me down
No, can't stop this train from rolling, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, forever only no
Oh, you can't take it down
No, never stop this locomotion, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, you can't bring it down because I'm
Can't stop this train from rolling
Forever on and on and on
Forever on and on, on
Better Than You
Feel so good, I feel so fine
Love that little lady, always on my mind
She gives me love every night and day
Never going to leave her, never going away
Someone to love me, you know she makes me feel alright, alright
Someone to need me, love me every single night, yeah
Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we are making love it's something out of this world
Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Going to love that woman 'til the end of time, ah
Someone to live for, I'll love her 'til the end of time
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know that she's all mine
I am the world that hides the universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces is my one and only crime
I lived a thousand times, I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images, the unborn child never was conceived
You got to believe me, hey, I'm talking to you
Well, I know it's hard for you to know the reason why
And I know you'll understand when it's time to die
I don't believe the life you have will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep to let your soul live on
The motherfuckers got in my head
Trying to make me someone else instead
It's my world now
It's my world
"Mama, why's it raining in my room?"
"Cheer up boy clouds will move on soon!"
Heavy fog got me lost inside
Gonna sit right back and enjoy this ride
You can't have it
It's my world, It's my world
Sucker!
I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out
Who's in charge of my head today
Dancing devils in angels way
It's my time now
It's my time
Yeah, it's my time!
Look out motherfuckers here I come
Gonna make my head my home
The sons of bitches tried to take my head
Tried to make me someone else instead
Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is
God it feels like it only rains on me
Sucka!
Enough's enough
Yeah Yeah
Ooooohhhh
Bad
Come clean, confess up
Tell all, spill gut
Off the veil, stand revealed
Show the cards
Bring it on
Break the seal
(Ladies and Gentleman, step right up and
See the man who told the truth)
Swing the noose again
Pierce the apple skin
You bit more than you need
Now you're choking
On a bad seed
Ahh choking
Let on, load off
Confess, cast off
At the mercy, the cat is out
Drop the disguise
Spit it up
Spit it out
(And now, what you've all been waiting for
I give you He Who Suffers The Truth)
Choking on a bad seed
Off the veil
Stand revealed
Break the Seal
At the mercy
Cat is out
Spit it out now!
(Swing the noose again, Pierce the apple skin, you bit more than you need, choking on the seed)
On a
Choking, choking, choking on a bad seed
Choking on a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, seed
Hate is a train
That thunders aimless through my head
And hate is the fame
Chained to the wheel until I am dead
Rage is a flame
Creates a touch to boil the seas
And rage is to blame
Forever sorry I shall be
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge, no
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
Straight down into the sorrow, but still I stand
Wrath is the name
Branding suffer onto you
And wrath takes the shame
And holds me down until it is through
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
And hate is a train
That hungers for the flesh's call
And hate takes the blame
A beast that never slows at all
Burst into flame, the bitter end
And shake this gates of hell again
Yeah, cursed to drown in sorrow
Free speech, free speech for the dumb
Free fucking speech
I've got to see you moving fast, see you come my way
See the dreams, I hope they last, never fade away
Got to see the lights above, make it loud tonight
Got to set it all afire, set it all alight
See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar
I am going to set you all alight
Got to make it man, I haven't got a choice
Got to fill this hall tonight
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless
I don't know what I'm going to do, maybe not tonight
Got to set you all afire, got to treat you right
I can see the flashing lights, lit before your love
Got to hear the thunder roar, coming from above
I can see the stars, I can see what's going on
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday
This stage is mine, music is my destiny
Cannot squeeze the life from me
Unchain the colours, before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return, from out of the... Fire!
Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody, not this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
Flickers above us, to light up the... Sky!
Scan the horizon, the clouds lift me higher
But I shall return from out of the...
Fire, Yeah!
Fire
Fire!
Tear it down
Strip the layers off
My turpentine
Old paint, old looks
Cover up the past
White heat, white light
Super white bones
Bones of you and I
Pure if I... can't you help me?
Pure if I... won't you help me?
Purify, you and I
You and I, purify
Purify!
Truth and dare
Peeling back the skin
Acid wash, ghost white
Ultra clean
Wanna be skeleton
Clear eyes, diamond eyes
Strip the past of mine
My sweet turpentine
Oh, purify!
I can find the dirt on anything
I ain't dancing with your skeletons
I, I ain't dancing with what might have been
Pure if I... why won't you help me?
Come on, purify
Oh, poor twisted me
I feast on sympathy
I chew on suffer, I chew on agony
Swallow whole the pain
Oh, it's too good to be
That all this misery
Is just for, oh, poor twisted me
Poor twisted me
Poor mistreated me
I drown without a sea
Lungs fill with sorrow
Lungs fill with misery
Inhaling the deep, dark blue
Oh, woe is me
Such a burden to be
The poor mistreated me
To finally reach the shore, survive the storm
Now you're bare and cold, the sea was warm
So warm, you bathe your soul again
Baby, again, and again, and again
You finally reached the shore, survived the storm
Good to feel my friend
Yo, poor twisted me
Rebel, grip your bottle tight
Just float away
Rebel, is it hard to leave
What makes you stay?
Go take your poison ink
Sign life away
Then take your dirty spoon
And dig your grave
Dig your grave
Rebel grips the bottle tight
Just floats away
Rebel finds it hard to leave
He takes the poison ink
Signing life away
Then takes the dirty spoon
And digs his grave
Let this dark shine
Let it shine bright
Don't let it burn out tonight
Kill me one more time
Stigmata
Neo martyr
Going to die young
Going to live forever
Rise up
Rebel of Babylon
Resurrection
Renegade fights the fight
That no one wins
He claims a crown of thorns
To pierce the skin
He climbs his crucifix
And waits for dawn
Thinks they'll remember him
After he's gone
This rebel fights the fight
To claim a crown of thorns
To pierce his skin
Climbs his crucifix
He loses consciousness
The myth lives on
Tonight
Don't go looking for snakes you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
Ohh, watch the puppets dancing
Yeah, see the clowns fall down
Hey, tie your tap shoes tightly
Yeah, and wear them into town
See you crawling
See you crawling in
There ain't no heroes here no more
Hey hey hey
Ooh, play the game so nicely
Oh, check, its your move now
Yeah, we are standing in this jungle
Yeah, with serpents I have found
Then your heroes disappeared
No there ain't no heroes here no more
There ain't no heroes here, looking for snakes you might find them
Haven't I seen you before?
Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them, yeah
1, 2, 3, 4
Motives changing, day to day
The fire increases, masks decay
I look at the river, white foam floats down
The body's poisoned, got to sit tight
The wait
After wakening, silence grows
The screams subside, distortion shows
Mutant thoughts of bad mouthed news
Is just another birth of distorted views
Suppose I say
I'm never satisfied
You cut some root
To make the tree survive
Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once
I'm oh so bored to death
Ohh, I hunger
I hunger
I eat
Born Into Attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
What ever happened to sweat?
The vultures smile at me
I've sent them down
And they plan to pick you clean
And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction's here and gone, gone
Yeah gone again
Just let me kill you once for me
I'm bored to death
Yeah, I hunger
Look inside and you will see
The words are cutting deep inside my brain
Thunder burning, quickly burning
Knife of words is driving me insane, insane
Raven black is on my track
He shows me how to neutralize the knife
Show to me in surgery
The art of fighting words to conquer life, conquer life
Now the wicked lance of fear
Is driving from my heady mountain brain
Crash course in brain surgery
Has stopped the bloody knife of words again
Now I see his face, I see his smile
Such a lonely place, no golden mile
Eyes tell of morbid tales, of his black heart
His deeds through ages past tell of his part
See his face, see his smile
Time to die, o-oh, no-oh, no-oh
Angel from below, change my dreams
I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem
I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn
I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns
I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way
Devil take my soul, with diamonds you repay
I don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cry
And I will burn in hell, from the day I die
I am going to be a rock and roll star
Got to groove from night to day
Got to blow my crummy job
Going to blow my blues away
I am going to make a stand
Going to make a million
Going to make it with you
I am going to be wild my friend
I got to push it through
It's electric
I stop on red and I leave on amber
Danger paves my way
I am going to make it my friend
Going to make it today
Going to kick this dust from my heels
Down the highway I go
Going to get the stars from my route
Make it in a rock and roll show
There's nowhere else I can run to
She's wretched, but she comforts me
And after everyone goes home
She's always there for me
And when the sun goes hell-bound
And the moon does resurrect the night
I will hide within her
Not much good has come out of the light
After everyone goes home
And I'm left here on my own
I will, run straight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
When they turn out all their lights
And I'm left to brood at night
Always, return to Hell and back
Straight down, yeah
A lonely light in a window
Just longing for some company
Tragic, heartless, and hateful
But there's nothing as willing as she
And when the night has fallen
It falls hard and then it all begins
When she starts her calling
I feel my darkness growing from within
I will, run straight to Hell and back... no
I become two
We become one
Unbridled, unequal
Unholy, undone
The path is cut deep
The path is worn well
I follow my footsteps
To the warmth of Hell
The warmth of Hell
Return to Hell and back
Straight down
From where I stand I see
Pain, suffering, and misery
The more I see (the more I see)
The less, the less I believe
Hate, violence, and war
The less, the less I believe, yeah
I believe
Pain, suffer, and misery, yeah
The more I see
The more I see, yeah
Sound of gunfire comes through the night
Killing and hatred, it is a terrible sight
Reports come in of the heavy attack
Message is seen, we are moving back
Preparations are made for the journey back
It is a survival, supplies are packed
No more nights in this eternal hell
Destination is simple, we move out
Killing time - You left from the line
Killing time - Your turn to kill
Killing time - What do you say
Killing time, ah killing time
And he knew what he needed to keep us alive
No time for cowardice, kill and survive
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
Nasty word, he will take your life
The silence is over, they attack again
Killing and hatred drive me insane
Reports come in of a heavy attack
'Gimme Fuel, 'gimme fire, 'gimme that which I desire!
Oouh...
Turn on the dynamo
Into the wild I go...
No other place I know!
I know
Warhorse, Warhead
Throttle up for speed ahead!
Yeah ahead...
Ooooh, on I burn
Burning hard, loose, and clean
Ooooh, and on I burn
Turning my direction
So 'gimme fuel, 'gimme fire, 'gimme that which I desire
Can't fight the need for speed
I'm loose (I'm loose), I'm clean (I'm clean)
I'm burning lean and mean
And mean!
Ignite the open trail
Excite (exceed), exhale, comin' on, hot from hell!
Yeah hot from hell!
Oooh, yeah-heh
On I burn!
(On, and on, and on..) 'Gimme me fuel
(On, and on, and on..) Give me fire
(On, and on, and on..) My desire
(On, and on, and on..)
(On, and on, and on..) Ooooh, on I burn
(On, and on, and on..) Fuel is pumping engines
(On, and on, and on..) Burning hard, loose, and clean
(On, and on, and on..) And I burn
(On, and on, and on..) Turning my direction
Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire!
Oouh!
Hey babe don't act so scared
All I want is some special care
On the run from some institution
All I want is some constellation
And I can tell by his face
I am a total disgrace
Put me inside this place
Move over for a damage case
Hey baby wait a minute, stop
Don't run away, don't call a cop
I am not looking to victimize you
All I want to do is tantalize you
I can tell by your face
I am all over this place
Got no time for a damage case, no time baby
Hey babe don't turn away
I am here tomorrow, gone today
I don't know what you think your game is
I don't care if you want your name is
And I can tell by this face
You are all over the place
I can tell by his face
Get the fuck over man
Only way to feel the noise
Is when it is good and loud
So good I can't believe it
Screaming with the crowd
Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Overkill, Overkill, Overkill
On your feet you feel the beat
It goes straight to your spine
Shake your head, you must be dead
If it don't make you fly
Know your body's made to move
You got to move it
I see that nothing has changed
Insist on playing games
Some waste of time you are
And you are so popular
Well this is it you bitch
I have got to make my switch
I am just another john
I know what's going on
Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
No, too late, too late
I thought you was for real
But you are a rip-off deal
Don't give me all that crap
I just escaped your trap
I think you see the joke
But you are just chasing smoke
You are not another one
Misunderstanding me
The way you feel so free
I am going to jump the gun
Oh I am gonna hit and run
Your credibility
Don't cut no ice with me
Another privilege gone
Oh oh, too late, too late
Opposition - Contradiction
Premonition - Compromise
Agitation - Violation
Masturbation... On our face
Darkest color: Blistered Earth... True death of life
Never hunger - Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure...
Struggle within triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends...
Halls of Justice painted green, money talking
Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
Hammer of Justice crushes you, overpower
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Justice is lost - Justice is raped - Justice is gone
Pulling your strings... Justice is done
Seeking no truth - Winning is all
Apathy, their stepping stone, so unfeeling
Hidden, deep animosity, so deceiving
Thru your eyes, their light burns, hoping to find
Blackened is the end - Winter it will send
Throwing all you see into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth - Never a rebirth
Evolution's end - Never will it mend... Never
In the exit of Humanity
Color our world blackened! Blackened!
Eah, we did it. It's on fire
Louder! Yeah we did it. It's on fire
We are ready to rock this, ready to rock this
We got Metallica, Metallica in here
Ja Rule, Swizz, Swizz the monster

(Diamond Head Cover)
Over and under, do you go down to the sea
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sweet and timely caress, dear babe fulfillin' me
I can feel her heart, it is beating down inside
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Faster......love....

Shoot me
Faster, faster
Love, sucking my love
Oh Lord, sucking my love
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
Well just pass him there
Why should we even care?
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
Where he traveled time
For the future of mankind
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfold
Now the time is here
For iron man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron man lives again!
You think you see me in the glass
You think you hear me better listen fast
I think I see you gone to seed
Think your reason is your guilt and greed
You are out there on your own
Your face turned to stone
What ever happened to your life
Stone dead forever
All right
You are a financial wizard
Top tycoon
You are Sweet long lizard
With a silver spoon
You know you have never had it
Quite so good
And you didn't know
That you even could
Your time has come to own
Your touch turned to gold
What ever happened to your life?
It's been a long time
It's been a long long wait
And you caught your fingers
In the pearly gates
You better leave your number
And we will call you
You know your problem
That's not exactly new
Your time has come today
Your face has turned to hey
Finished with my woman, 'cause she couldn't help me
With my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frownin'
All the time
All day long, I think of things, but nothin' seems
To satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something
To pacify
Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah!
I need someone to show me the things in life
That I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind
Make a joke an' I will sigh an' you will laugh
An' I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel an' love, to me
Is so unreal
An' so, as you hear these words tellin' you now
Of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could
But it's too late
These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms
Through these fields of destruction
Baptism of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battles raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
Through the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms
There are many different worlds
So many different suns
But we all have just one world
But we live in different ones
Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man's got to die
But it's written in the starlight
And in the line on your palm
We're all fools to make war
On our brothers in arms
Yea, we're all fools
We're all fools
Oh, such fools
To make war
On our brothers (x3)
So, what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna play back
some of the band's new songs.
There'll be no cameras allowed
in there.
There'll be no video,
no bags in there.
You can only walk in
with paper and a pencil.
- We're ready.
- Are there any questions?
You want a single?
Camera over here.
Was there ever a moment you
thought about stopping with Metallica
or the whole band was falling apart?
Was it a kind of a power struggle
between you and him?
How did you manage
to solve this crisis?
Where in God's name are you
getting this aggression from
on this new album?
Where's it coming from?
Why did it take so long to release
an album with the new songs?
After    years,
is it possible to retain the fire
that, you know, you guys once had
at the beginning?
Do you think the young generation of
metal fans will accept the new album?
Eighty-five million records,    years.
I think it's    albums
and various official releases.
One word.
Oh, my God.
One word to span our career?
We are scanning the scene
In the city tonight
We're looking for you
To start up a fight
There is an evil feeling in our brains
But it's nothing new
You know it drives us insane
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying,      deaths
Searching
Seek and destroy
Thank you!
After    years of headbanging,
Metallica bassist Jason Newsted
has quit the band, citing:
"Private and personal reasons
and the physical damage that I've done
to myself over the years
while playing the music I love."
Metallica's management had no
comment when asked by MTV News
if there's a replacement
waiting in the wings.
But the band is still scheduled to begin
recording a new album this spring.
That's the news for now.
Stay tuned for more news.
I mean, I think everybody understands
the concept of trusting instincts.
That's getting to a place where
you don't let egos and let stuff
get in the way of artistic expression.
You know?
I mean, do you wanna say more?
I think everybody understands...
I met Metallica through
Q Prime Management,
after having seen me work
with another band of theirs,
when they called
and said that Metallica,
with Jason announcing
that he was exiting the group,
needed to take a look
at itself and say:
"Well, what's going on here? We've lost
touch with our personal relationships,"
and face some of the issues that I think
Q Prime felt that they were headed for.
You know, we haven't really worked
together for almost nine months.
When we were talking a couple
of days ago about whether--
You know, if we wanted
to do this film or not,
I was wondering if having these
guys in here would affect that.
Because I'm just--
There's an intimacy that you get
when it's just a few people
in the room,
and I'm just wondering
if that's gonna get lost,
if we're gonna go back
to sort of, like,
battling each other and trying
to be, like, all strong and--
What intimacy?
What the fuck are you talking about?
I think, to me, it's not gonna
be a matter of whether
the cameras are in play,
but whether or not you guys
are free enough
to risk being seen by other people.
We're here in the Presidio
in San Francisco,
and this is gonna be the location
where Metallica
is gonna start recording
their next album.
We decided that we didn't wanna
go back into a studio again
and do kind of, like, the same thing
we had done before.
We had to kind of change things up.
And this is one of the things
that we talked about,
was to go into a space
that's not a studio,
bring in kind of, like, a portable studio
or a makeshift studio,
and basically make
the situation uncomfortable.
You know, don't buy new furniture,
don't paint the walls.
Don't do anything.
Just keep it Spartan, keep it crude.
They're such a success
that you can get comfortable.
I don't think they wanna be
comfortable.
There's definitely a vibe in here.
They got a lot of attitude,
and I think they want it
to come out on this next album.
How did you approach
this record differently?
Did you talk about things, did you
have ideas, keywords, things like that,
that you wanted to put across
before you started
putting the whole thing together?
Well, ego was a big one.
Coming in here
and not bringing a riff,
not bringing a song,
not bringing a title. Nothing.
Me and James did not meet
somewhere else
and come in here with material,
with songs, with music.
This time we all got in a room
and just started playing.
And that's how we wrote songs.
The idea is it should
sound like a band getting together
in a garage for the first time.
Only the band's Metallica.
I really like going fast.
Just go off and meditate
in the wind, you know.
As corny as it sounds, it works,
and it feels good.
It's a good way to just let the weight
of the world off every once in a while.
It is-- It is kind of strange being,
you know,
like, a famous guy. You know.
This is-- This is part of me
that's trying to be unfamous, I guess.
But it's also
go-against-the-rules attitude.
You know, is this a big pose?
I mean, yes, this is a pose.
I mean, am I driving down the street
to not get noticed in this thing?
I mean, "rebellious" is kind of
what this says, I would say.
- Have you got a plug-in here?
- Wait.
So, what exactly are you doing?
Well, you'll just hold it
above the pickups.
Oh, okay. I got you.
I got some bad news.
Gonna have to--
Change the lyrics?
I like this thing, Bob.
- What?
- I like this thing.
I used to kid myself that art was
my great escape away from music.
And I think I've become
increasingly aware
that my interest in art, music
and Metallica
is not separate from anything.
You know, where does he feel
that there's enough
of that kind of gold thing?
How come there isn't
another    strokes
up in that black area up there,
where it's kind of bare?
Where are the starting points
and the end points,
if you know what I mean?
When's a song done?
What the fuck does
that mean, anyway? Done.
When's a record done?
You know, where does a record start?
Where does it end?
Where does the process start?
Where does the process end?
All that type of stuff.
Do you know what I mean?
- Daddy!
- It's really interesting.
Yes, sweetie.
I don't feel anything great there.
I don't think
it's that great of a riff either.
- How do you hear the riff then?
- I like that:
And then:
Yeah.
In nine days, it'll be
my two-year anniversary of surfing.
It's taken the place of a lot
of bad things in my life.
So I basically stopped doing
the drugs that I was doing
and cut way back on my drinking.
You can't surf
when you're hung-over.
You can't surf if you've been up
all night. Well, at least I can't.
There's a sort of individualism,
also, about surfing that I like.
I mean, when it's your moment, man,
that's your moment and yours alone.
And no one can help you.
For all intents and purposes, we go
into this record completely equal.
Everybody contributing
just as much on the lyric front
as James contributing
with drum parts and...
As soon as you started talking
about that, I just like...
Yeah. Yeah. You flash back now.
Well...
You wanna hear it with vocals?
Go sing it.
You guys had some rules
about that before.
Quite frankly, I don't give a fuck.
I'm tired of arguing.
You couldn't talk about his lyrics,
therefore, he couldn't talk about
your drumming.
- Right.
- Do you know what I mean?
And you and him did the solos,
so you weren't allowed to comment
on the solos.
There was, like, rules.
Are you telling me that
those boundaries are gone now?
In the past, what we did was
started with a bunch of ideas existing
on tape from everybody.
Then me and James would sit down
and turn those ideas into songs.
And then we would tell the rest
of the band what to play
and when to play
and how to play it.
There was never any,
just, other ways of doing it.
You know, it's a whole new thing
for me.
You know, writing in front
of everybody,
because I've always just gone
into my own head
and wrote stuff down,
instead of taking things from outside
and putting them down.
What I was thinking is, is like--
"These are the hands that--"
"This is the face that--"
So it's, like--
Building a Frankenstein
or something?
- Yeah. Pretty much.
- Building what?
- "This is the top of my head that's flat."
- A Frankenstein.
"These are my bolts..."
We're on the same
stream of consciousness here.
We're just all working
on the same creative wavelength.
And it's inspiring to me.
Now I can further express myself
with these lyrics
now that, you know, James has
opened that door for Lars and I.
- This is "clay," right?
- Yeah.
- Not "clam."
- Clay.
"These hands finger the clam."
These are the eyes
That can't see through me
This is the tongue
That speaks on the inside
Make sure you really, like,
spit "can't see me."
That can't see me!
That can't see me
These are the hands
That drop your trust
- "This is the--"
This is the eye--
This is the eye
This is the hand
That drops your trust
These are the boots
That kick you around
- What is this about?
- Well, I mean, I said Frankenstein.
It's not that far off,
talking about pieces of things.
So, I mean, some kind of monster.
Some kind of monster?
- You know?
- Some kind of monster.
- It is-- It is good.
- You know what I mean?
I like that.
The monster lives
"We come now to create
our album of life.
Throughout our individual
and collective journeys,
sometimes through pain and conflict,
we've discovered the true meaning
of family.
As we accomplish ultimate
togetherness,
we become healers of ourselves
and the countless who embrace us
and our message.
We have learned,
and we understand.
Now we must share."
- So that's just--
- A mission statement.
- A what statement?
- Mission statement.
- Mission?
- Yeah, mission.
- It's like-- You know, it sets a goal,
so you just can, like, just always be
reminded of, you know--
You know, what the ultimate goal is.
All right.
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, my world
Excellent.
Come on, little man. Let's go.
Skylar, do you want your purse?
- Daddy.
- I'll come. I'll come.
Come, Daddy. Come, Daddy.
I don't know how you guys feel, but
it's really awesome what we're doing.
The four of us can just go
in a fucking room
and roll that kind of shit
out of our sleeves.
Pull it out of thin air, man.
It's so exciting, because
that has just never happened before.
I couldn't get to sleep last night,
because I was still wired from it all.
How do you feel? You don't
seem really psyched about it.
What the hell.
- How's it going? Good to see you.
- Yeah, thank you.
- How many bears did you kill?
- Two.
Russia's fucked up.
You know, it was like,
you put a bottle of water here
on the table.
That was it,
a bottle of vodka sitting there.
- Did you drink vodka?
- Hell, yeah.
- You did?
- What else is there to drink?
As soon as you got there,
it was like, "Na zdoroviya!"
Na zdoroviya!
That's a pretty big bear.
- Is bear edible?
- They were no good to eat.
That freaked me out when
they didn't take any meat.
You know, they have been hibernating
for three months,
so they haven't pissed or shit
or nothing.
- Oh, so they're toxic?
Third day, I killed my bear,
and I was just in camp
for the rest of the time.
I was like, "Oh, my God."
- Worked on lyrics?
- Yeah. I actually did.
That was a lot of time, man.
A lot of time.
I worked on lyrics in Siberia.
How to drink vodka
and work on lyrics.
Temptation
Wreck my head
Make you dead
Sucks my soul
Fill no hole
Fuck you up
No, no, no, no
I can't say no
Can't say no
No
Oh, no
Go away
Just leave me be
So, what were the reactions you got
from those close?
I mean, how did the family react?
I'm just-- I don't know.
Sometimes I'm a real ass about it
and just come in and say,
"Oh, by the way,
I'm going to Russia for two weeks
right here."
You know, and, "What?" You know.
Yeah, I'm getting better at that,
because that was the most
I missed my family ever.
And it was, you know,
Castor's first birthday I missed.
- And it was--
Of course, we had a little vodka
to Castor.
Did a little shot for him
and everything.
But I would've loved to have
been able to get ahold of home.
Who's here?
This is Daddy working.
- This is where Dad works?
- What does your dad do for work?
- Drums.
- He plays drums?
- Let me play drums.
- Is he good at it?
- Daddy, wanna play drums?
- I played drums a lot today already.
I'm okay. You play for a while.
- Those guys,
- That's very good.
you know, their plate is filled
with many, many things.
And music is just one of the things.
- Say, "Bye, James."
- Bye, James.
Bye, buddy.
I chose not to have children
and do those kind of things.
My music, that's my children.
Daddy's gonna stay and work
for a little while.
But since I decided to do it
with music,
then that's what I have
to fill my time with.
Echobrain is one of the projects
that I've been working on for years.
And now it's come to fruition.
And then when it comes to the time
where my main cat, James,
tells me that basically
he couldn't be in a band with me
if I did the--
Took this other project to this level.
And after    years of working
together and going on buses
and, you know, the stories, man...
There was no way that this thing
that I was doing
could affect the monster of Metallica.
I just don't see how it could.
And so-- And saying things like that,
I couldn't accept that kind of
limited acceptance.
I also know that this relationship
is not over.
You know, he'll-- It'll come
around again at some point.
You guys will make contact.
At that time the managers suggested
that we have a psychotherapist
come in,
a man that meets
with pro-ball teams,
you know, big-ego, big-dollar guys
that can't get along
but have to make
some kind of entity flow
so everybody else and everybody
can make their money.
And I actually said:
"I think that this is
really fucking lame
and weak that we
cannot get together. Us.
Look, the biggest heavy band
of all time.
And the things we've been through,
and decisions we've made
about squillions of dollars
and squillions of people.
And this, we can't get over this?"
Was it more than just
the Echobrain thing?
Because that's, like, you know,
what has been discussed.
He felt like he wasn't free enough
to do what he needed to do.
Since he wasn't getting his creativity
out enough in Metallica,
he needed to get it out
somewhere else.
And I totally understand that now.
And...
On my side of that was,
I didn't want him to enjoy that
more than Metallica.
I didn't want anyone
to leave Metallica.
I didn't want to feel
that we weren't enough
or something like that.
And it was-- Through my--
I guess the way I learned how
to love things
was just to choke them to death.
"Don't go anywhere. Don't leave."
"You have to stay here."
Okay.
Need a pen, none of this pencil shit.
Check it out, man,
he can't even fucking spell it right.
"Metllica."
We've only been together    years.
I feel guilty that I'm not inspired
all the time.
You know, especially
when everyone else is.
It's like, "Okay."
We kind of get to the point
where the song is looped twice
in the Pro Tools,
and I know Bob's gonna hit me up
for some kind of lyric ideas.
"Oh, shit." I was, like,
dreading the whole process.
It's like, "Why are you dreading it?
Why don't you just--?"
Well, you're dreading it
because of what?
- Let's get to the fear.
- Well, because I didn't have anything.
- And so if you didn't have anything--
- Wasn't inspired enough
to have something or letting down
the team or some vibe like that.
One, two, three, five.
Say it, I'm lonely, yeah
Motherfucking in my head
It's like I'm almost,
like, racing against time.
There's, like, weird-ass fear of like:
"I gotta come up with something
myself really quick
before somebody else comes up
with something for me."
And then if I don't like it
or don't     percent embrace it,
then I'm just being a selfish,
you know, insular asshole.
It's a fear response.
When we're up against a fear,
that's the time to move into it,
forward.
Because there's going to be
some kind of genius there
or some kind of breakthrough.
Motherfucker, yeah
Metallica. Metallica.
Kirk.
Kirk. Kirk!
- Kirk.
- Kirk!
- Yes.
- James is trying to talk to you.
- Sorry, man.
Yeah, it's a bit stock.
Check it out, guys.
I don't know how you feel.
I'm in a shit mood.
And I'm not digging it right now.
Even last night, I gotta tell you,
everybody kind of looked--
I hate to tell you, looked pretty burnt.
I agree.
And if we don't start earlier
and end earlier, I'm just--
I'm not gonna be in a good mood
for the rest of this shit, you know?
That was totally weird for me.
You hear that, Bob?
Why don't you try getting
a more solid beat.
- Regular.
- Oh, well, you can call it regular.
- You called it regular.
- No, I'm trying not to call it regular,
because I know it bugs you
when I call it regular.
So a little more solid, then.
Fuck!
Maybe we should talk
about next week.
- Well, all next week is therapy.
Do we have to do that?
Can we sack Phil?
I mean, we gotta find--
We gotta find a balance to not--
You know, the Phil stuff's important,
and I hope we all feel that that's
an investment in the music.
It's an important part of the record.
Get all holy again
Let me just go put one together.
- It's just real confusing sounding.
- It's just jacking the vocals all up.
I mean-- I mean,
it's clever and everything.
But, I mean, I don't see
what it does to the--
I think that's how you hear it, dude.
That's fine.
I'm just trying to do something
different.
I mean, I'm-- I'm used to having
the drummer do the beat part.
You know what I mean?
Holding it together.
What I'm hearing is...
Choose my words carefully here.
It's pretty straightforward.
And the guitar shit, it's--
You know, it's a little stock.
So I started trying to introduce
some kind of edge to it on the drums.
Those things we throw out
to each other are complete bullshit.
You know? "It sounds too stock.
It sounds too normal to me."
I mean--
You're saying this shit
so you can get your point across
about doing a drum beat.
I mean... You know,
it doesn't hold any water.
- To you.
- It doesn't.
I think it's fucking stock. What--?
Which part of that is unclear to you?
I think it sounds stock to my ears.
I mean, do you want me
to write it down? I think--
- Oh, yeah, please write it down.
- It feels stock, okay?
- I can't hear you.
- So l--
No, when you say-- You're telling
me what to play, right now.
You're telling me, "You should
play with what Kirk's doing."
- And I'm telling you it's stock.
- Dude, fine.
You know what, you guys, why don't
we just go in and hammer it out,
all right, instead of hammering
on each other.
We're in shit moods, and we're not
gonna get anything done here today.
- All you wanna do is pick a fight.
- I don't wanna pick a fight.
This is so silly.
You're just sitting there going:
"I'm in a really pissy mood and--"
And I fucking told you
straight up that I was!
- And what are you trying to do?
I'm not trying to do fucking shit.
You're just sitting here
being a complete dick.
You're-- You're really helping matters.
You're really good at that.
I was straight up with you,
and I told you, I'm in a shit mood.
And what have you been doing?
Fucking picking at me all night.
Come on, guys.
We've got better things to do.
Yeah, I do. I do.
Metallica front man, James Hetfield,
has entered a rehabilitation facility
to undergo treatment for alcoholism
and other undisclosed addictions.
In a statement posted
on Metallica's official website,
the band writes, "James has entered
an undisclosed facility,
and he will continue to receive
treatment until further notice.
Until then we have postponed
all current activities,
including recording sessions
for our new album."
Metallica, whose hard-partying ways
earned them the nickname Alcoholica,
have been working on their follow-up
to the      double disc...
I think it's easy to see that,
in those days,
Metallica brought a kind of
physicality to rock 'n' roll.
Let's say the Beatles,
the Rolling Stones,
you know, and all that inspired
some of the British rock music
that then developed after that.
And let's say the metal music
and Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath
and all of that.
And then, out of that again,
then, let's say,
then came Lars
and all of that and being--
So I think that they have certainly
a place in all of that, I think.
Lars had a very good vision
at the time
of where he saw that particular--
You know, the metal music going,
because he could see it
with European ears and eyes maybe.
Don't you feel that it's great for you
to have your father's perspective on
who you are and what you're doing?
I think that's incredible.
You talk about the lineage...
Which we did,
we talked a little bit
about your grandfather.
It's very difficult to admit it,
especially with him standing next to me.
It's easier to talk about it
when he's not in my presence.
But...
Of course it is.
What would you--?
What would you say in private?
- To who?
- To anybody, without him here.
Say it.
You know, what would it be?
Well, I mean, I've already said it
to you countless times.
Well, have you said it to him?
You brought it up. I didn't bring it up.
What is it you feel you've said
that you're not saying now?
I think maybe in some ways
some of the--
To me that's--
Fear of status quo comes a little bit
from this direction over here.
I think that--
I mean, there's nothing worse
than when I have to go to him
and play the new record
and know there's something
on there that sucks.
And he can see right through that
in two and a half seconds flat.
Comments on that one?
I would say, you know, if you said:
"If you were our adviser,
what would you say?"
Then I would say, "Delete that."
I don't know for you guys.
For me, it doesn't cut it.
- But--
- Interesting. I mean, it's interesting.
You know, now-- I mean, other
than the people involved here,
the only other people who've heard
any of this music is Cliff Burnstein.
When Cliff Burnstein heard that, he
thought that should open the record.
Yeah. I mean, that could well be.
But I'm pretty sure that--
That I really-- That I really--
I really don't think so.
- For me, that--
That doesn't sound right
or something. You know?
Unless I'm a guy
that's kind of shouting
in some kind of echo chamber.
So I think one
of our responsibilities here
is to act like a band
that's still continuing.
We're going on.
We're doing our exploring.
We're exploring ourselves individually,
we're exploring our relationships.
And we really need to get together,
talk about this,
act like the band exists,
because it does exist.
And if we don't do that,
then we are the coproducers
of the process slipping off the planet.
This is a bit
of a shit sandwich, though.
What does it--?
The unravelling of a band?
And then there were two?
So a good friend of mine
phoned me.
And he knew where James was.
- Really?
He couldn't even imagine James
doing anything for six months.
I'm prepared for the worst.
I'm pretty confident that, you know,
we will come together
when the time is right.
But knowing when
that time will come,
or not knowing
when that time will come,
is very, very uncomfortable.
I hope that at some point
he will come back
and try and finish the making
of this record.
lf...
If he walked away from Metallica,
I'm not sure
that it would surprise me.
Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
I've always felt that James
was a softer, more caring,
compassionate person than he
allowed himself to be to most people.
I can remember
from the Dave Mustaine days,
I mean, when him and Dave Mustaine,
these guys, they started right away
with their big, you know,
chests beating and their mannerisms,
and the whole thing was very much
about this kind of, like, macho--
It was just, like--
I couldn't deal with that stuff.
And looking back on, I mean,
what was that,       years ago,
I mean, I just felt so alienated,
because it was just so far removed
from the upbringing
that I come from.
Well, here's to you, my friends.
But then, at the same time,
I'm starting to realizing now
that the sort of depressive things
that show up
as a result of the alcohol
and stuff like that,
it was just very difficult for him
to communicate from the heart.
- You want some or not?
- And not hide behind
a lot of these different fronts.
Whether it's alcohol, that gives
him a false sense of strength
or the front man in Metallica
or, you know, macho bullshit
and all that stuff.
All right, now you guys are drunk,
and I'm drunk.
Now this is the fun part, man.
I want to help him.
I want to be there for him.
And I want to do the best I can
to make him the best person
that he can be.
So I don't know how the fuck
it's gonna play out.
It's really healthy for me to be here
without any pressure
or anything related to the band
or anyone who would remind me
of the band.
And to recognize what's real.
Our sessions with Phil really stirred up
a lot of things in James
that he thought that he needed
to address.
Mentally, it's really taken--
Taken its toll on myself, you know,
and I'm very worried about him.
And, you know, whenever
you check yourself into rehab,
they don't-- They don't focus on, you
know, the fact that you're an alcoholic.
They go much deeper, you know?
I mean, they go way deep.
They crack you open
and then spill you out
and examine all the things
that are on the table.
I've spoken to him a few times,
and, you know,
I know he's having a rough trip.
No matter how bad it gets, eventually
things seem to sort themselves out,
sooner or later.
Whether it's good or bad,
they sort themselves out.
I watched the people
around the world say
what a great guitar player Kirk is
and what a piece of shit I am.
And that I got kicked out of Metallica.
And I wasn't good enough for them.
And that I was a loser.
And I've had to deal with that
for almost    years.
It's a dreadful experience.
It's been hard, Lars.
It's been hard to watch everything that
you guys do and you touch turn to gold
and everything I do fucking backfire.
And I'm sure there's
a lot of people that
they would consider my backfire
complete success.
You know? And am I happy
being number two? No.
You know? You're just now
encountering something
I've been going
through       years.
I've never had a chance
to be able to tell you without
talking to Lars, the guy in Metallica.
Never talked to my little Danish
friend again. You know?
I remember the day you and I talked
about digging a hole in fucking dirt
and smoking hash
through the ground.
That to me is the stuff that's, like--
You know? And we've never had
very many moments like that.
Do I feel some guilt? Yes, I do.
But at the same time,
it's difficult for me to comprehend
that the only thing that you feel
when you look back
on the last    years
is rooted in the Metallica thing.
Have you ever thought what--?
What I've been through?
I think I've had an awareness
of the pain I caused you.
That's not what I said.
Do you have any idea--?
- Of what I put you through.
- No, no, no, what I went through.
I mean, people hate me
because of you.
You know, I walk down the street,
and I hear some piece of shit
say "Metallica" at me,
and they do that to taunt me.
I mean, when I would hear Metallica
on the radio,
I would be like,
"God, I have to turn this off,"
because I just keep thinking,
"I fucked up!"
Right.
I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.
You know? And by no means
is it done because
somebody else very important
is not here.
Do I wish it was      all over again,
and you guys woke me up and say:
"Hey, Dave, you know what?
You need to go to AA"? Yeah.
I'd give anything for that chance.
Is there any last words you wanna
say to everybody out there?
Metal up your ass!
Okay, thank you. This is Donna Davis,
and this is Metallica.
This is, like, a pretty bitchin' club
to play the first fucking gig.
- How do you guys feel?
- Stoked.
- Freaking out.
- Freaking out?
- Totally. Totally.
It's un-fucking-believable is what
it comes down to. Can I say that?
- You can say whatever you want.
- It's fucking unbelievable.
Echobrain. Yeah.
I don't know, I just-- All of a sudden
this became such a big production.
I don't understand.
It's like all of a sudden, like--
I get one phone call, it's like everybody
and their fucking brother are in town.
I thought it'd be Jason, like,
playing with his new band
in front of, you know, like,    drunks
down at some bar or something.
And now, I guess, to my own
ignorance or something, l--
That's what-- I guess that's
what I wanted it to be.
So now I'm realizing that supposedly
it's a little more of a big deal than that.
- Hey, what's happening, man?
- What's going on?
- Sounded good, man. Very good.
- Thanks. Thanks, man, thanks.
- Awesome. Awesome.
- Oh, thanks. Right on.
- I'm Lars. How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.
Where's Jason?
- Jas?
- I don't know.
I think he went back to--
I think he already fucking bailed.
- He went back to--
Nice. Go back to say hey,
and he's, like, fucking gone.
Elvis has left the building.
There's Zach. Hey, Zach.
See, he's even blowing me off.
Jason blows me off.
Zach blows me off.
How quick we become
yesterday's news.
No-- No kidding.
See, there's a guy
in an Echobrain T-shirt.
Yeah, that's Steve over there.
He works at the studio with us.
Well, he is.
I remember that guy.
I remember him.
He worked at the studio.
- Which guy?
- Over there.
- The guy in the red shorts?
- No, the guy in the black
that's walking across right now.
Kessel.
Todd. He works at the studio too,
doesn't he?
- Who?
- Todd over there.
I'm sure they're all here, Bob.
I mean, the only two people
in the Bay Area
not working for him is me and you.
Hetfield's gonna freak.
I'm in fucking hell.
This whole gig has brought
all of this on.
Yes, it has.
It's made me feel like--
- You really wanna come clean.
- It made me feel like such a loser.
I mean, I can't hold my band together,
you know.
I start records,
I don't finish them.
I fucking--
Jason is the future.
Metallica's the past.
I've never had a break like this
in    years.
Do you know what I mean? And just--
What's been kind of getting me
is just not knowing.
You know what I mean? Not knowing
and not hearing, it just eats away at you.
- Kirk talked to him.
- I talked to James today.
What did he say?
He basically said that,
you know, he just--
His family's the priority right now,
and he needs time to work
on his family
before he can reach out
to his other family, being us.
And that he loves us,
and he just needs for us
to understand that he needs time.
And he also went on
about how difficult it was
talking to you about it,
because he felt pressured.
And, you know, he spoke
about how you always need
to be in control of the situation or in
control of the schedule or whatever.
And he said that this is a time
he needs complete control
of the situation.
And he said, you know, all the
Marc Reiters and the Bob Rocks,
all that stuff, you know, just has--
"I can't think of that right now."
So, you know, I got the feeling that
he kind of lumps in your relationship
with the business side of things,
which was actually
really surprising to me.
But I think that's--
You know, that explains--
I think that explains a lot
on why he hasn't spoken to you.
We're just in limbo, and the longer
James chooses to stay away
from dealing with us,
the further we drift apart.
And I just feel so disrespected.
And that's the key thing.
Was the future of the group
ever in doubt?
Even when James went
into rehab, do you think?
Lars and I, we were wondering
when James was going to finally feel
like he was in a situation
where he can come back
to the band.
And after a certain amount of months,
you know, Lars and I started to think:
"Well, is he ever gonna come back
to the band?"
And that was a really big question
on our plates.
Whether or not, you know,
he wanted to come back.
James wrote something in the new
issue of our magazine, So What!
He wrote a kind of
a little handwritten note.
That note was probably
the most heartfelt thing
that I'd ever seen come
from his mind.
Tomorrow is shaping up,
or is gearing itself up to be,
yes, the first sit-down
with one James Hetfield post-rehab.
Why are we filming this?
I don't know.
We're in very different places.
Or at least I am in a very different
place than I was from the Presidio.
That's a huge understatement.
So we just have to find that if--
You know, if the movie will be
as intense, you know.
To me there was a lot of intrusion,
and I kind of went with it and felt--
I felt uncomfortable.
I felt uncomfortable with it.
You know, a boom
following me around,
and it just felt like I was
in the spotlight all the time.
And I didn't--
I guess I don't really like that feeling.
While we were in the Presidio
filming you guys playing,
- did you feel it then too?
It was-- It was pretty much
Do you think you're
in a better place now?
- We gotta find some...
- I'm definitely in a better place.
Some place that
makes you feel comfortable.
And the last thing we wanna do
is have it impede on your music,
because that's more important
than anything.
You know, one answer
may be there--
Maybe there shouldn't be a film.
I mean, that's the range of possibilities
that we should really think about,
because, I mean,
why do you guys want a film?
Even you said you hope
that the film is made. I mean--
That's a big question,
because, for me, it was really just--
It came along with being in Metallica.
"Hey, we're gonna do this."
"Oh, okay."
That's part of this, all of this...
The bigness of Metallica,
and I'm kind of tired of it.
You might look at it as a friend.
To me, it's been a beast.
And it's sucked a lot of me into it.
You were maybe the keeper
of the beast at one point.
You know, because you were the
champion of that fifth-- That entity.
And, of course,
you gotta find the right balance
between what
everybody's personal needs are,
but if Metallica collectively decides
to do this,
then I think Metallica
can make it happen.
I don't know. That scares me again.
Metallica is three individuals.
And three individuals have to decide
if it's good to do.
But I still think that the priority
is the collective
until all the people involved
in the collective
say that the priority
is the individual.
And so far, you're the only one
that said the priority is the individual.
I haven't said that.
He hasn't said that.
I haven't heard him say that.
So I feel that it's still--
There's still an unbalance there.
We met from, like, maybe,
I don't know, six or eight weeks
before we actually picked up
the project again.
That was when we came in,
and it was the first time
we actually used this studio, HQ.
Anyway, here we are. HQ.
Right on. Well, we're here.
And the camera's here.
And my friend the boom is here.
- Hovering.
- Yeah. Cool.
Do you want me to play the music?
Yeah, let's go. I'm--
I'll put the big speakers on.
I was afraid to pick up a guitar
and fearful of what would happen.
Would I not like it? Would I love it?
Would I not be able to write
anything cool?
Would I write just recovery stuff?
James.
It was probably the best sound
I've ever heard in my life,
just the fact that you
were playing guitar in here.
- Hey, Zach.
- Right on, brother.
Play a riff.
- Nothing.
See? It feels pretty good, doesn't it?
- It feels like the next day.
A year later, the next day.
It will be interesting
working on this schedule,
because we really haven't.
It's gonna be great.
And kind of the overview is, you know,
the less time we have here,
the more productive we'll be,
in a way, you know?
It's like we're more focused
on getting the stuff done.
That all sounds really good.
Okay. Now, let's revisit it in a week.
So I think that, don't talk it, walk it.
At some point, we are gonna
have to work a little harder.
- You know, when that feels right.
What do you mean?
What does that mean?
- What does that mean?
When you say harder,
does that mean more hours?
You know, if we can go deep
real quick,
be intense...
I spoke up because,
"What does that mean,
we have to, you know,
do eight hours now?"
- And I got fearful right then.
- That's okay.
I mean, it's like... Yeah.
- To do eight hours?
- No.
Any lyric ideas?
I'm searching for--
Searching for doughnuts.
- Searching for doughnuts
What was the whole thing
from yesterday?
- The Buddhist--
- Guarantee-- What?
No, the Buddhist thing that you had.
Birth is pain, life is pain,
death is pain.
The cycle of suffering.
It's called samsara.
Where are you with this, James?
Somewhere else.
Where's today's sweat going?
"I've worn out being afraid.
My endless parade
of fear that I've constantly made."
"My lifestyle determines
my deathstyle.
A rising tide that pushes
to the other side."
I've worn out being afraid
Endless parade
Of fear that I've constantly made
Frantic tick tick tick tock
I gladly trade
Oh, I need know the answer
Where I'll be laid
I can't find it
- It just-- It doesn't work.
- The great--
You did one great thing.
You went:
You did this one syncopated thing.
Do the whole verse like that.
An endless stream of fear
That I've made
Frantic tick tick tock
I'll gladly trade
It's weird. It's weird. And it works.
No, but the second time you felt
really comfortable with it.
- Oh, by the way, it's quarter to  .
I gotta get rolling, guys. Sorry.
I feel like the bad guy saying,
"I gotta go because it's  :  ."
If we all know, and we all do know,
that  :   is kind of the stop time,
then, I don't know, then I won't feel
like the heel here, saying:
"I gotta go eat dinner
with my kids," you know.
Because I have a feeling
I'm gonna walk out of here,
and you're gonna go in there
and listen to this stuff,
- and it's like, that's not right.
- That's not.
I mean, if I wanna listen to it,
I'll go and listen to it.
But we should at least listen to it--
But I know you'll sit there
and start talking with Bob.
Maybe Bob doesn't wanna sit
in there, and when I'm gone,
things get talked about
and decisions are made.
And I feel I walk into something
that's already kind of decided.
And it's a total uphill battle
for me a lot of times.
I don't like that feeling.
Well, that's, like,
just like the last    years,
- for me.
Well, let's talk about this
tomorrow, then, all right?
- Or do you wanna take time out--?
- No, I don't have time right now,
because it's past  .
It's hard to introduce structure
into this, and I'm trying.
So, what do you think, Lars?
Can we hear the song
That we all heard together?
How is that different?
Because we all heard it
together already.
- He wants to be part of everything.
- Was I in there?
Yes, you were.
We all heard it together yesterday.
- You came in.
- All right.
As long as you don't talk about it.
- Is that a way around it, or--?
- That is definitely a way around it.
How about if we just save up
the tension?
Seriously. I mean, that's okay,
because tension produces results.
I'm excited to see
what you learned here.
Up and back. Up and freeze.
What is this called?
Arabesque.
Super proud of you, sweetie.
I'm so glad I got to see it.
I'm working on--
Really hard, on being
the best dad and father
and husband I can be.
And the best me.
You worked hard.
I don't wanna lose
any of the stuff I have.
I know it could all go away
at one time,
and that's a tough part of life.
And then-- And it's just--
It's a total rebirth for me,
looking at life in a whole new way.
You know, all the other drinking and
all the other junk that I was stuck in,
it was so predictable, so boring.
I'm out there looking for excitement
in all this stuff.
The results are the same, man.
I wake up the next day somewhere
in some bed,
I don't know who this person
is next to me,
and I'm drunk, completely hung-over
and have a show to do.
And the result is the same.
When life now is pretty exciting.
You don't know
what's gonna happen
when you're kind of clear
and here and in the now.
In the moment.
My lifestyle determines
My deathstyle
A rising tide
That pushes to the other side
I think those two feel the best to me.
It's a tough one to decide.
They all kind of got
some charm, don't you think?
Yeah, I'd be interested to hear
the first one.
From the first take.
Well, let's play it.
- Is it okay?
- Are we allowed?
- Yeah, we are.
- Do we have--?
- We never really settled that, did we?
- We didn't settle it.
Yes. We're allowed.
Well, I'd like to hear it.
Feel free to leave the room, whoever
doesn't want to be part of that.
I felt like it was an agreement.
We're gonna work from    to
and then we would not work.
Well, if Lars and I
listen to something
or go through the Presidio stuff,
it's not because we wanna do
something behind your back.
It's for you.
And basically what I heard
is, "No, I can't do that."
- What the fuck is that?
- I don't know, my mind gets lopsided.
The more it goes in a different
direction, the harder it is.
The harder it is to get that back.
What is it you have to get back?
Some control. Some sense
of involvement in the band.
When I was running this morning,
I was thinking about seeing you today,
and the word "fuck"
just comes up so much.
Seriously, it's really true.
- Is that in anger?
- No, just, "Fuck!"
"Fuck."
I just think you're
so fucking self-absorbed.
And what makes it worse is
that you always talk about...
You always talk about me.
You use the word "control"
and "manipulation" a lot.
I think you control on purpose,
and I think you control inadvertently.
I think you control by the rules
you always set.
I think you control by how you
always judge people.
I think you control by your absence.
I think you control all of this
even when you're not here.
I don't understand who you are.
I don't understand the program.
I don't understand all this stuff,
okay?
I realize now that I barely
knew you before.
And all these rules
and all this shit, man,
this is a fucking rock 'n' roll band.
I don't want fucking rules.
I understand that you need
to leave at  .
I respect it.
But don't tell me I can't sit and listen to
something with Bob at  :   if I want to.
What the fuck is that?
You know, I don't wanna end up
like Jason, okay?
I don't want to be pushed away.
I don't want it to happen twice.
Let's do it, and let's fucking do it
full-on or let's not do it at all.
Fuck. See?
Fuck.
- Yeah!
- Metallica. Yeah!
Rock 'n' roll.
Let's hear it for Elena!
We're not anywhere near
getting any issues resolved.
Well, let's get them.
That's what we're here to do.
I don't know. I guess the playing part,
being in the room,
and then mainly being in the room
with Lars, playing music together.
I guess I had higher expectations,
and I don't know,
maybe I'm disappointed in myself.
Maybe... I don't know.
You wanna talk about that?
I mean, what does that mean?
I'm not enjoying being in the room
with you playing.
Searching, yeah
If you are not having any fun,
let me let it be known to you that
I'm not having a lot of fun either.
But I've-- I am not interested
in playing music with you
if you're not happy in there.
I just don't want to be a--
Become a fucking parody.
Okay? So if you're not happy
playing music with me:
Is there enough that connects us
to hold on
for a way through this?
There are moments
where I really doubt it.
Really doubt it.
I'm glad you said that.
Because I really, deep down,
feel sometimes that it's just...
There's just some empty, just...
Just an ugly feeling inside.
Just... I don't know.
How much work
do we gotta put into this?
- Then you're doing the:
Let's do our little roundtable thing
right now, quickly.
Everybody's gotta participate.
Lars, come on.
Hey, Castor, why don't you look at all
the boys-- The men, I should say.
And say bye to everybody.
Bye, Castor.
Thank you for coming.
- Is Daddy going bye?
- No, your dada's staying here, okay?
- Bye, guys.
- See you.
So, what's the deal? How does
everybody feel about what they heard?
The chorus lyrics will definitely work
in that feel.
- That kind of intro bit that's on there.
- What about you? What do you think?
- It's good.
You think it's good? Was there
anything in particular that you...?
No, I wasn't paying attention
that detailed.
That's just-- It's a lot of good stuff.
I can take you back, when me and him
were alone in my room, in
listening to the new wave of
British heavy-metal singles.
As soon as there was somebody else
it just became this, like-- It just had
a very different energy to it.
- Is there any of that that's usable?
- That's a fuck-- That's a fucking bitch.
- Let's do another version of it, okay?
The first time I got
a real awareness of it
was when Mustaine came
into the picture.
When James was with Mustaine,
he became like he never
really cared about me.
One time during the recording
of the Ride the Lightning record,
where me and him went out and--
So    beers later,
it was like, "Oh, dude, I love you."
But it could never have materialized
until it got to that   -beer point
and we were alone.
That was good.
Are you sure I don't have
to play it again?
Yeah, I'm sure.
It's good practice, though.
- For what?
- The road.
- When?
- A couple years.
From day one, it's been competitive.
And in a way, that's what has made
Metallica what it is.
That's what's driven us further.
What feels good to you?
I'm gonna try a bunch more.
Can you try maybe like a:
Almost like a strum.
My parents split
when I was    or   .
And then my mom passed on
when I was   .
The only thing I felt that I really had,
at that point, was music.
My wanting to keep everything
under control,
and, you know, it's out of a fear
of my abandonment issues.
I'm afraid to get close to people
because I don't know how to do it.
how you're supposed to do it.
- Cool.
- That last one was pretty good.
Yes.
That's the first amp I ever owned.
That right there.
I think we have it.
Okay. Now we gotta talk about it.
You started talking about the idea of
the guitar solo, as we have known it,
maybe being something that was
a little outdated
and maybe reintroducing
some riff-o-rama things.
But can I say something
that I think is bullshit?
This whole fucking solo out,
you know, dates the whole thing.
That's so bullshit. You know?
If you put a guitar-- If you don't play
a guitar solo in one of these songs,
that dates it to this period.
And that cements it to a trend
that's happening in music right now.
I think that's stupid,
and I think it's totally trendy.
I know that's not what I said.
It's always been about,
like, where could it go
that's kind of new and interesting,
instead of just repeating
something from the past.
I'm not interested in playing
traditional guitar solos anymore.
- You know, that's just-- For me, it's--
- And you told me that.
It's just boring, you know.
To me, if you can add a colour
to the song
that satisfies you and works
for the song,
then that's what we should do with it.
But I don't wanna get in the position
where it's like,
we put something down on the tape
to satisfy your ego,
my ego, Lars' ego or James' ego.
I think it should serve
what's going down.
Like, in other words, there shouldn't be,
like, a rule of no solos.
There shouldn't be a rule of solos.
It should be--
And I agree.
I mean, it really is, to me,
all about serving the song,
I feel much better about that,
because, you know, I just don't wanna
follow certain trends
that I see other bands following.
We don't necessarily have
to stick to our traditional way,
but we also don't have
to follow that trend.
I'm actually very, very comfortable
with my role in the band, you know?
I've actually always been very, very
comfortable with my role in the band.
I'm not a really egotistical person.
In fact, I've-- I spend a large
amount of my time trying to, like,
downplay my ego
and get it even smaller and smaller.
That's part of my beliefs.
I try to be an example
of being egoless to the other guys.
Hi! This is Kirk from Metallica.
And if you want money,
you'll listen to us.
And then some other guy's
gonna give you cash.
Twenty years' worth of integrity,
credibility and all that.
The next five minutes
is gonna change all that.
"Hey, man, keep it locked right here,
and--" What?
"We'll help you score $    ."
This is James from Metallica.
Survey says, you need cash.
Your money-shot to snatch
a bunch of cash is coming soon.
In order to suck both
nationwide radio chains off,
we are now standing here
having to do this fucking stupid thing.
Up to    motherfucking grand,
goddamn it!
Win a bunch of money.
And walk away.
This is stupid!
Sharpen that booger-picking finger
and be the   th--
Hey, it's Lars from Metallica. I'm
about to stick    grand up your ass.
One dollar at a time.
I was telling Lars last night
that was hard for me to see
- you guys squirm like you were.
Because I wanted to say anything,
and it's not my place to say anything.
I can't imagine Bono or the Edge
going on the radio,
saying what you guys
are being asked to say.
- Dad, can I have one of those?
- Go for it.
Should we catch up
on all this radio stuff?
Okay. Now, they're
the biggest chain in America.
You know, it's like       stations
or something.
And if you guys think it's crappy, as a
radio thing, those guys think it's good.
I mean, that's their idea.
We didn't come up with that.
So strategically--
Why are we doing it, then?
Just to make them happy?
That's exactly what they're doing.
And they won't say, "Fuck you,
you never do anything for us.
We're gonna fuck you
on the next record. "
People would do that?
"Because you didn't give us something,
we're gonna fuck you?"
Yes, James. They would.
I'm not saying that they
can always get away with it.
That's so funny.
- It wouldn't stop them from trying.
- I'm glad it's your world.
I understand the "wash your back,
you wash mine" thing.
"Wash my--" "I'll wash your back
so you don't stab mine,"
- is more like it.
Okay. Why don't we get off
the phone, then.
Well, you know, we should have this
conversation some more next week.
- Later.
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.
That's insanity. "We're gonna hurt you
because we didn't get something."
I wash your back
so you don't stab mine.
Well, that's a good line for a song.
I guess I just want something
to rhyme with "mine" right now.
Wash your back so you won't...
Wash your back
so you won't stab mine.
Step on a landmine.
Keep you in my back pocket.
Blind leading the blind.
I'll rip out your fucking spine.
So you won't stab mine
- That was really good.
- Are you pulling my mike?
- It was.
- Really good.
- So then, the part--
Landmine
No landmines
Rock lobster
There's a witch at the foot of my bed.
Did you--?
Did you hear what Lars said?
He says, "Yeah, Kirk stopped reading,
and I stopped moping."
- That's what you said.
- That's not what I said.
- What'd you say?
- I said, I stopped sulking.
Oh, sulking.
Shit!
In the    months since he's
parted company with Metallica,
ex-bassist Jason Newsted has been
apparently more musically active
than his former band mates.
While Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich
was pursuing Napster,
and singer James Hetfield
battled alcoholism,
Newsted hooked up in the studio
with legendary metal band Voivod.
Our own lann Robinson got all the
answers on Newsted's new ventures
and the current state
of his relationship with Metallica.
A good friend hinted
that Jason would really like
to join the band again.
Man, I popped his little bubble
for a second and-- I don't know, man.
I'll be quite honest.
I think the heart and soul of Metallica,
from this point on,
and has been for a while, since
Cliff died, is the three of you guys.
I think you will never, ever, ever find
a permanent bass player.
My opinion.
There was also tragedy
in rock this week.
Metallica's bassist Cliff Burton
was killed in a bus accident
while the band was on tour
in Sweden. He was   .
Metallica bassist Cliff Burton
was buried on Tuesday
in the San Francisco area.
Remaining members of the band...
Jason Newsted.
He replaced Cliff Burton,
who was killed in an auto accident
in September.
Jason told...
It pisses me off that Cliff left us
because we'd never have
that initial four guys
just going on and on.
You know, when I talk about it,
it's like that happened for a reason.
And we're-- We're dealing with that.
I gotta capitalize
on what's being said right here.
The Cliff message that I get
from him to you guys is,
that treasure the three of you.
Treasure every moment
that the three of you have.
And the four of you have.
You know, treasure--
Treasure it because you never know.
And one of the sad things
that happens when somebody dies
is that people have never
taken the time along the way
to really embrace each other
every day. You know?
It's a sin if you--
You know, if you let that go.
Phil has been like an angel for me.
He's been sent to help me.
And, you know, I've got
my own thoughts about all that,
you know, a father figure,
the dad that never was
and all of that, that it makes
me comfort--
It comforts me.
But also, we don't want to have
our hand held through life.
We'd like to be able to stand proud
ourselves and move on.
There'll be a time for that.
And we just have to discuss
when that is.
You know, there is purpose
behind the way I do it.
I think it's very effective.
I have to decide whether
I'm going to push it or not.
It sometimes is a distraction.
So, what part of our career
are you gonna manage today?
I thought I'd do the whole thing,
since you guys can't do anything.
If you guys could run something,
then it would be easy to step back.
Because you can't, you know...
Is today the first day you're
gonna play drums?
- I don't wanna get into that.
No. I don't think
I'm gonna do the drums.
- I think it's time--
- Maybe I should.
- Yeah. I think it's time.
- Although, actually, I'm kind of...
Well, it's about the only thing
you haven't done.
- I haven't sung.
We got to a point
where we sat down and told Phil
that we wanted to scale Phil back
to every other week.
And we were getting ready
to implement that
four weeks from when
the decision was made.
And two weeks
after the decision was made,
we had to sit Phil down and say
that we were not ready to do that.
Because we got really...
I don't know. Scared, I guess.
There were some things
that were going on at the time
that, really, Phil helped with a lot.

The Metallica v. Napster battlefield
moved to San Mateo today.
Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich
delivered a list of screen names
of people who have downloaded
the band's music online.
Metallica is suing Napster,
a website that provides software
which allows people to download
music on the Internet without paying.
Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich testified
before a Senate committee
earlier this month that Napster has
"hijacked our music without asking."
The band said
that over        people
are downloading its music for free.
A group of former Metallica fans
staged a protest at the courthouse.
I don't want anything to do
with Metallica anymore.
I'm gonna be trashing their CDs.
I took all my CDs,
and I'm gonna be destroying them.
Are you proud
of what you achieved with Napster?
Are you proud in hindsight
of what you pulled off?
Being the most hated man
in rock 'n' roll?
Yeah, that was-- That was my goal.
I got an idea.
I'm kind of bored this summer.
Everything's going a little too well.
Let's see, I wanna turn myself
into the most hated fucking
asshole in rock 'n' roll, yeah.
Like, good afternoon, my name is, you
know, like, Lars Ulrich, from Metallica.
I worked for years to get
where I am today.
Me and my buddy
James Hetfield here
have shed blood, sweat and beer
to get where we are today.
Beer, good.
Who do you think you are?
I mean, just, you know,
because you, like, made us rich,
you think you can get free stuff?
Songs that we spent upwards
of, you know,
like    to    hours writing
and recording.
Our team of lawyers and researchers
have your names,
and you Napster users, we'll see you
in jail getting gang-raped.
Some minutes
I have all this strength,
and I can stand there and just go,
"Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
I'm bulletproof, it doesn't matter.
I got Hetfield and Hammett,
and we're a team, and fuck you."
Five minutes later,
it means nothing, and I just
become really vulnerable.
You know,
we never sat there and thought
about where Napster
was gonna end up.
We never sat there and talked about
what shots we were gonna take.
We just sat there and thought about,
this was something we had to do.
So wait a sec.
That was awesome!
It's like I had to stay
on the course that I was on
and stay to my convictions,
but it was eating away at me inside.
And then maybe it could go
lyrically to:
"What difference did l/we actually
make?" It's a great question. Great.
And if that could-- It's like if that
question could get thrown out there,
but remain unanswered,
I think that's really strong.
"All the shots I spit back at you."
That's awesome, dude.
Fucking...
- Fuck me.
- And the "what difference did I make"
- fit right in.
- Really awesome. Right on.
These two kicks,
are they the same as--?
- It's different.
Go to the master. What really gets
my dick hard is starting on:
You know, there.
Then these are awesome.
Lars, what I wanna know is,
do the four of you just go in there
and just jam?
You're hearing excerpts
of three-hour jams.
You're hearing-- Look at it as a funnel.
You're hearing the very part
of the bottom of the funnel.
- You can almost equate
- what we're doing now to arranging.
- You're like Pollock, the painter.
He is. He's Pollock,
the funnel-arranger guy.
It's gonna sound fucking amazing
at the stadium
with        people
fucking raising the evil horns
up to the sky and saying,
"Metallica, baby."
Oh, can we fast-forward
to that right now?
I think what I'd like to do is,
I'd like to talk about
this touring thing that has come up.
We're very cognizant of the fact
that things have changed
for you guys.
And they've changed
for many, many reasons.
Why can't we figure out what works
best for everybody
in their personal lives,
plus what works best as a business?
What if you just do a stadium tour,
where you play Friday, Saturday
and Sunday,
and then you go home
the rest of the week?
I just wanna put out that,
you know, it might be a kind
of uncomfortable vibe here
because people might not know
how I'm feeling about touring,
and I don't really know either.
You know? Until I get there.
And, you know, I wanna tour.
I don't wanna fall off the wagon,
I don't wanna go out there--
I don't know what it's like.
Doing things for the first time again, as
I think I've said before, it's a little scary.
I don't know about you,
but it's, like, summertime.
And to me, it's fucking
beer-drinking weather, yeah?
Yeah. Well, I'm gonna take time
right now and fucking have myself one,
and I just wanna say cheers
to all you guys
and fucking thanks for coming down
and getting nutty with us. Cheers.
I blew my voice out
on the "Black Album,"
doing "So What," the cover song.
And we had a bunch of Metallica
songs to do after that.
And I went to this coach. I didn't--
I didn't wanna go. I was scared.
I thought he was gonna make me
sing operatic.
But I went there,
and we just did warm-up stuff like this,
and this is the tape. And I've had
this same tape for-- Since then.
- Was there a turning point?
I think when we had accumulated
what we thought to be,
you know, a great kind of...
I don't know,
cross section of material,
we took stock, so to speak.
The only songs that
are gonna make it to the album
are the songs that
all four of us vote on.
And out of   -plus songs,
only four songs got all four votes.
Sweet Amber
- Yeah, right.
- Wow.
I mean, there's some explosive playing.
The shit just takes off.
It's like you guys have spent
all this time
to come back to find yourselves.
- That's what it sounds like to me.
- All right,    to go.
Yeah, how are you doing?
Do you wanna hear more?
- Wanna hear more?
- I'm just getting started.
Choke within my hands
Time, time, times like this
- Boy
- You got what you're coming to
- So
- Destruct the power within all
Across your spine
So that gets broken too
Temptation, fill no hole
No, no
You know, the first four songs
you've played me,
all pretty much knocked me out.
Okay? But if you've got it going, you
want it to hammer all the way through.
You want people to be able
to really listen and say:
"Jesus Christ, there's
no letting up from these guys.
There's no fucking letup."
Fuck ballads. You know?
There definitely is some Presidio stuff
that I felt, maybe--
You gotta analyse it. Maybe you're
watering it down in some way.
That's all.
- It's your call.
I know that...
"Temptation,"
I remember writing that thing.
It came out.
It flowed, totally, instantly.
"Temptation" kind of sums up
all the lyrics
that are in this new kind of project.
So-- And that-- And it's cool
because that was done
long before recovery
and all that, so...
I mean, I can tell that you're singing
your heart out.
You're definitely wearing your heart
on your sleeve on that song.
To me, it's more like a jam.
Is there a song in there?
Potentially.
You know, there's almost nothing
there that can't be turned
into something better than it is
or something
that could probably
get pretty fucking close
to being something
on a Metallica record.
You know, but then it just goes away
from what the purpose--
At least, what I see the purpose
being today,
which is show up with what you--
You know, what are your A-pluses?
Well, when I hear Lars talk
about "We can whip anything
into decent shape," I agree.
And we did that on
Load and ReLoad.
And this is us trying to choose
before we take it to those extremes,
you know?
- Exactly.
- That makes sense.
That was a pretty major thing that I
think Lars and I clicked on together,
that, wow, I'd heard him,
and he heard me.
Oh, it's like, "Oh, okay."
It's like it takes the cutting edge
off of it
or the personal attack off of it,
Things are a lot less dramatic
than they used to be
within the chemistry
of the four of us.
Less head games, abuse of power
and soap-opera bullshit.
But can we just do one thing?
For lack of a better word,
when it comes in with the drums,
I just want you to scream,
"Fuck,"
as hard as you can fucking scream.
Fuck
Okay. It should be slower.
It should be more like:
I want four of them. Do it again.
Lars is selling paintings
because he's ready to move on
to the next ten years
or next decade
or next phase of his life.
And a lot of what these paintings and
a lot of what this house represents
is the last ten years versus
a husband and father of two.
He's getting rid of some pretty
major and important pieces
in the majority of his collection.
He's wiping the slate clean.
Midnight, New York City.
One last look at the paintings.
Oh, well.
- It's a celebration.
- This is a celebration.
- Of how far you've come.
With Phil Towle.
This is a celebration.
Some paintings have visited us
for a while.
And now we wanna share them
with other people.
- Okay?
- Right, yeah. That's it.
- It's a choice.
- Okay, cool.
I never looked at it as an investment,
but I always looked it as--
Versus some of the other guys
that may be, like, taking
a big pile of money and parking
it in the bank,
I would always, like, take a big pile
of money and park it on my wall.
I can just feel some of the adulation
that other people have thrown
at these paintings,
and that makes me proud.
I've never been this close to it.
These are great paintings, whether
they sell for a dollar or for $    million.
The only thing that matters
is what pleasure
and what feeling you get out of that
moment you have with that painting.
And it's never been
about dollars and cents.
It's always been about something
greater than that.
But, fuck, they do look awesome.
I mean, fuck.
It's been a good time.
- And it will be a good time.
- To the future.
I feel better about this
than I thought I would, actually.
- It's weird, I don't know why.
Shit.
$      .
$
on the telephone.
It's two of you in the room,
selling right, fair warning at $      .
Jean Paul, $      .
Twenty-one is the moderna
on the reverse,
the Jean-Michel Basquiat showing
on the screen there on my right.
- All right, here we go.
- Be strong, my friend.

.    million.

- Can we get more cocktails?
- $      --

- Come on,  .
- For you, sir, $      .
And selling at $  million.
Brett, yours at   million.
- Hi.
It went well.
I got myself drunk to numb the pain.
But it went well. I'm happy.
Like, let's talk about the zone
for a minute.
Because there is a way to help
a person-- Persons get in a zone.
To-- I mean, you could consider
seriously doing some meditative,
or apply the meditative principles
to music, all right?
I don't want this to sound
too way-out,
but if you do that,
the four of you are out there,
and you do it anyway, unconsciously,
you do a musical meditation
by starting to jam with each other.
I just think,
no matter how you look at it,
I've been making records a very
long time, and it really comes down
to how much work you put in
and how much...
You know, it's just tough. Sometimes
it's just-- It's just tough work.
And I like to stretch the frontiers
of what people accept, okay?
And I understand about that.
And l--
I don't want, for my mind, to settle...
I guess I'm not gonna
be playing today, then, huh?
Well, I'm gonna go out
and make phone calls.
So everybody's...
You know, we've had
a fabulous few weeks
with a lot of great productivity,
a lot of really good stuff going on.
The more we feel good
about ourselves and each other
and the higher we ascend,
the more challenging
it will be to our psyches.
You know, I understand it.
I embrace it and all that stuff,
but sometimes it just bugs me.
I think the-- That thing was
kind of bugging me yesterday.
All of them around the studio,
it was just kind of, like--
That way of thinking, it just
doesn't work for me all the time.
And I was a little pissed off at it,
because right now in my life
it's not really working for me.
- I'm glad to know that's how you feel.
- I agree with that wholeheartedly.
And if you feel that way
and wish to share that more directly,
- I'd appreciate that too.
- Rather than tearing the signs down?
- We pay him $      a month
to be pretty much available
at our beck and call.
So when this record's done,
do we want to collectively end
the $     -a-month, full-on thing?
I'm afraid he's under the impression
that he's, like, in the band, you know?
And I see him coming on the road,
maybe, for a week.
But after that I don't-- I don't see him
holding our hand
any further than that.
So is that something we wanna
present to him, then?
- Yeah. I think that--
I think it's something--
Yeah, I think it's something
we need to do
for our own well-being.
Yeah, because
I'm feeling uncomfortable.
Yeah, hello? Hello, hello.
Are they on the phone?
They're on the phone,
and they need you.
Oh, okay.
- James Hetfield is in the room.
- Hey there.
- Hey, James, how you doing?
- Pretty good.
I'll let Marc do the talking. He's
the one who's been talking to MTV.
Okay, this afternoon,
the official offer came in for ICON.
- Assuming you wanna do it.
- Let's do it.
Cool, man.
Yeah, I'm jazzed about it.
The only thing that you guys
are required to do
is show up for rehearsal
and then show up
for the show on the  rd,
and at the end of the show
you guys take the stage
and perform a little bit.
- So, what's Jason's role in all this?
- What? Who?
Cliff? I mean,
I don't think Jason has any role.
He lost his icon status
when he left Metallica.
- Nice one, Cliff.
- Thank you.
I think MTV would like the fact
that this would most likely be
the introductory performance
of Metallica with a new bass player,
whether it's the new member
or whoever.
When is it supposed to be?
May what?
May  rd. Saturday, May  rd.
See, that means you'd have
to hire someone by the  nd.
- I think it can happen.
You'd be required to be in
Los Angeles for all of two days...
Because we didn't get a new
bass player, I think a lot of people
thought maybe that we were
having trouble finding one.
We never started looking for a new
bass player until two months ago.
We worked on ourselves,
identified what part can we work on
so when someone else steps in,
it's clean.
They're not stepping in our shit,
All right, thinking about
bass players, finally?
So we're gonna need
a fourth member.
You know, we know you're
a great bass player. It's the vibe.
We need to make sure...
Jason kind of triggered this whole thing
a couple of years ago.
And I can't believe it's been two years.
And now we've gone through some...
We realized that we kind of wanted
somebody who was, like, our age.
Somebody who had been
around the block a couple times.
We've grown a lot, man.
These three guys
and this band.
And last time, when we did this
years ago,
years ago, I guess it was,
we literally sat down and started
auditioning bass players,
you know, the day after
the funeral for Cliff.
So now it's    years later,
different circumstances.
When Jason left,
he took his basses with him.
Do you want a four or five?
Whatever.
What five-strings do you have?
This one's a five-string.
Keep searching
Keep on searching
This search goes on
The band-- These guys
collectively probably own,
like, five to     guitars,
so they're not all here.
On and on
Tick tick tick tick tick tick tock
Frantic
You went into
another voice there, dude.
Which one of me are you talking to?
Think that we should just spend the
next two and a half hours with this guy.
Don't you?
I had a vision of us jamming
with him the last hour.
I guess I just feel this is just
kind of, like, weird to keep,
like, just doing our own thing.
It just feels not welcoming.
This morning I heard him say
he was pretty comfortable.
It's not about what he says.
It's about what I feel.
- All right?
- Are we cool, James?
Yeah. I guess the only other thing
I'd like to say is,
you know, when we leave this up
to just how we're feeling,
a lot of it depends
on how you're feeling.
when you say those things.
Not that I wanna break up
what you guys are discussing,
if you wanna go deeper, you know?
But I think what might be really good
is to treat this with respect,
go out and do this...
Metallica stuff?
- I could try "Battery."
- "Battery"?
You can play that fast
with your fingers?
Battery
That's a fucking pretty mighty
bass sound you got going there.
- Yeah, it's fucking--
It's the Mesa and the Hiwatt.
Is there anything else you know
as well as that?
Cliff. It was just like you saw Cliff,
and me and James went,
"He's in our band, there's no question."
He hit it out of the park.
And that's where it
sort of gets interesting.
Because if Cliff Burton
showed up today,
maybe he wouldn't be the guy either.
I mean, the three guys that I like
all have unique features
that I would love to Frankenstein,
- Yeah! Definitely.
- Some kind of monster?
That would be great.
I don't think you should settle.
I think you should get the right guy.
If you don't hit it out of the park
with one of these guys,
then you're gonna end up
four years down the road
in the same situation you did
with Jason.
A four count, then...
And into the solo.
Just follow.
He was the first guy of any of them
- that didn't look like he was struggling.
- That's what I told Bob.
Do you know what I mean
about, like, it--?
You know, with some
of the other guys,
it was sort of    percent
over their capabilities,
or something like that. You don't
feel that with this guy at all.
It's like the last three songs,
like "Sanitarium," "Nothing Else
Matters" and what was...?
- "Sad But True."
- "Sad But True," they were flawless.
I looked over at him
during "Whiplash,"
and he was just right in the pocket
and in there.
And then afterwards, when he
played it alone with his finger,
it hadn't been played that way
since Cliff.
It's just, like:
- Yeah, his finger's a pick, you know?
- Yeah, it's three picks.
All right, are we
gonna sack Bob now?
Well, the second time
you came back,
I mean, that was, for me,
when I noticed
that you make us play better, man.
You make the band sound
so much better.
- So solid.
- How do you feel about that, man?
Well, I feel awesome, man.
- You're the chosen one.
- You looked coolest.
And we want you to be a real member
of this band, not just a hired hand.
And we'd like to offer you--
Basically, to give--
To show you how serious
we are about this,
offer you a million dollars
to join our band right now.
- And--
- Wait, okay.
And as a kind of a good-faith thing
about how serious we are--
It's an advance.
It's an advance on some percentage
you're gonna be making
with the band.
Here's money up front to get you
kicked in and inspired and:
"This is a reality. This is my future.
This is what life can hold for me
with my new family."
I can't really talk right now.
Falling through the grid
There's things that I miss,
and I'm sad it couldn't work out,
and things, you know, like that. But
there's way, way, way, way more times
and way more days and even hours
that go by and I'm reminded, "Dude,
all right.
You did the right thing."
You know, "You did the right thing
for yourself."
I don't know if it's the right time
to say this,
but, I don't know,
I've been thinking about our talk.
About, you know, you and us and
our future and all of that stuff, and...
And, you know, when I heard
that you guys were moving here
and all of that, that brought up
a lot of fear around:
"Wow, what is Phil's perception of,
you know, his, you know, longevity
with Metallica?" You know?
That scared me a little bit.
Well, I appreciate that. I was--
If it scared you, and that's part
of the issue going forward,
then let me say we haven't decided
we're moving here.
I've tried to make it clear
that we're selling--
I think we've told people we're selling
our house in Kansas City,
but that doesn't mean
we're moving here, okay?
And we won't likely move
to San Francisco
if there's not a future out there
with Metallica,
because, you know, that's my--
I wanna make sure
that the bass player's intact.
I wanna be sure that the tour's on.
And I also, as I said,
have performance-coach visions
for each of you and for the band.
And l-- To me, the work isn't over.
I'd like us to honour what we had,
and if you wanna be away from--
You know, on your own or something
for the couple of months
until we come back in June,
that's okay. I just kind of--
I don't know. I guess I have a problem
with the, "Let's see how it works out.
Let's see how it happens,"
and then, "No, let's honour what
happened, you know, six months ago."
You know? That's kind of strange
to me, you know?
Because I think that you use
those things
when they're convenient at times,
Personal stuff or business things.
And I don't know. I don't know.
They're-- The boundaries are--
I don't-- Becoming more clear to me.
There's that element of-- Of trust that
just kind of floats with you with me.
And l-- And that-- I'm really sorry
about that. That-- You know.
I've been swimming uphill on that one
for a long time with you,
and I'd like for us
to be able to resolve it.
But maybe we can't.
I've gotta tell you that l--
You know, if the client,
either James or us, says:
You know, then I really think that
needs to be respected without,
you know, just, you know,
the old turn-the-knife thing in there.
You know, it's just, you know,
if the client says,
you know, timeout for a while,
timeout.
That is great, although we--
Our process, what we normally do--
Then it should be put on the table,
but left on the table,
and should be able to walk away
without what you're saying right now,
which is now there are trust issues
and stuff.
I don't know how to separate out--
In its simplest form,
I think it's a conflict of interest
that you tell him that he needs
you around more.
- If he has--
- No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not saying that.
I see that as a conflict of interest.
Look, I am saying you guys
have made a decision.
It's okay for me to say
I'm not happy with that decision.
The premise is,
you guys don't need me.
And I'm good with that.
Anyway, you go... It's--
- Anyway, let's jam.
- Great, I'll see you guys.
I'm taking off. I'll see you
next week. Have a good one.
Thanks, man.
Who's in charge of my head today?
Dancing devils in angel's way
Look out, motherfuckers
Here I come
I'm gonna make my head my home
The sons of bitches
Try to take my head
Tried to make me
Someone else instead
You've been in the band for five
minutes, and you're an icon?
It's such an honour,
and, you know, I'm stoked. So...
Your voting interest will equal
your percentage interest
in a new account,
while each of our voting interests
will be one-third of the difference
between     percent
and your percentage.
This is about as lawyer as you get.
But it's really--
- Sort of laying out--
- Yeah, lays out the deal.
Okay, so, for instance, in the first
period you have   percent, okay?
So when we do a vote, you
get    votes, you get    votes,
you get    votes, you get five votes,
in any vote, okay?
- But this doesn't mean anything.
- I think it's crap. I mean, l--
I think in the spirit
of what we're trying to do,
we better do    and then
Q Prime's the tiebreaker. That's--
That works, that's fine. Cool.
Now, here it also says, "You will not
be required to fund any losses
in the new Metallica account,
but we will be entitled
to recover any losses out
of future profits."
For instance, buying the documentary,
it's not your problem.
If the documentary loses money
and the company never makes
any more money again,
it's these three guys' problem.
Exactly.
"What'd you do with your money?"
"I went and bought a car,
I bought my mom a house,
and we went and bought
a documentary."
It was just-- You gotta keep
in the spirit of this whole thing.
By the end of this week,
we're gonna have an album title.
Because in three days, we won't
have to agonize about this anymore.
Well, the thing that stood out to me
was St. Anger. It's strong.
I mean, there's--
Iconic strong, you know?
- I like that title quite a bit.
- It's so easy
just to say,
"June   th is St. Anger's Day."
- Yeah, well, it's true. That's cool.
- No, I mean--
I think Frantic is a better album title.
- I think that's--
- It's more about the record.
- But St. Anger's a good--
It's an original statement.
St. Anger, St. Anger.
Well, this is an angry record,
but you read the lyrics,
it's angry in a healthy way.
- It's also frantic.
- Getting stuff out.
Frantic is more like,
"They're trying things that they don't--
They don't--
They're not exactly sure of.
They don't know what they're doing.
They're trying to climb back up
the mountain again.
They're not sure of themselves."
I mean, hello, that's a fair thing.
I mean, if you think that Frantic
has a negative connotation to it,
I never thought of it like that.
If it's St. Anger,
they're gonna form an image of:
"These guys are angry. I know it.
They're angry about Napster.
They're angry about the new stuff
that's coming in.
They're angry about their lives.
I'm angry too. I get it."
I think you guys know the idea about
shooting a video in San Quentin.
So let me get this straight.
You're gonna go to
a maximum-security prison,
and Metallica's gonna play
"St. Anger" really loud.
St. Anger 'round my neck
I've been asked to come out here
and talk a little bit
about what this song means to us.
Anger's an emotion that I've struggled
with for pretty much all my life.
- St. Anger 'round my neck
- You flush it out, you flush it out
There's a lot of misspent anger
that has come out sideways
for a lot of people.
Including yourselves.
And if I hadn't had music in my life,
it's quite possible I could be in here,
or not even in here, be dead.
And I'd much rather be alive.
Madly in anger with you
I'm pretty nervous up here.
I don't really know what to say.
I'm just trying to share
some of what's going on for me.
I'm not here to sell nothing,
that's for damn sure.
Everyone is born good.
Everyone's got the same size soul,
and we're here to connect with that.
So we're very proud to be
in your house
and play some music for you.
Thanks.
More than any other record,
I don't know if you feel that,
but for me, this is like product
of what we're just doing, hanging out.
- It's almost like a diary.
It's like, here's our memories on CD,
It's like we've proven that
you can make aggressive music
- without negative energy.
Okay, and I don't think anybody ever
thought that that would be possible.
You know? You can make
something that's aggressive
and fucked up, okay?
With positive energy
- between the people creating it.
It hit me, you know? This project's
coming to an end, and I don't know,
I think I'm kind of bummed
about that.
I'm kind of, just, kind of liking
the schedule that happens,
or the safeness in that.
Coming here, being able to talk.
Creating, you know?
And... I don't know.
I've been kind of coming down
from this for about the past month.
I mean, getting up at   in the morning,
and just pacing my apartment.
Just not really knowing
what the hell I'm doing either.
So I'm with you.
Like, I don't wanna let you go home.
I really appreciate that.
That's really nice of you to say.
I don't know, I can feel myself
kind of protecting myself
with some depression or something,
wanting to just kind of isolate.
And I don't wanna do that.
I wanna feel the sadness of--
I mean, I didn't feel depressed,
I felt sad.
And that's when I knew it was
something different than just me...
My old stuff, you know?
I mean, there is some of that, but...
Sadness and depression, I guess
I don't really know the difference.
And, Phil, all the stuff
that you've brought here to, like...
You've set out all the tools,
like, you know?
And you allowed us to build
what we've built, you know?
With guidance.
I really appreciate your bringing
this forward.
And there is a difference between
sadness and depression.
Clearly.
This is the hugest chapter in my life.
Would I use them to get
Back on track?
Stand back. Stand back.
Keep away from the car.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Can I find it inside
To deal with what I shouldn't know?
You live it or lie it
My lifestyle determines my deathstyle
Determines my deathstyle
Go!
Thank you so much
for supporting Metallica through all
the rough times and all the great times.
Metallica loves you!
Fucking a!
Metallica! Metallica! Metallica!
I'm only happy when it rains
I'm only happy when it's complicated
And though I know you can't appreciate it
You know I love it when the news is bad
And why it feels so good to feel so sad
Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down on me
I feel good when things are going wrong
I only listen to the sad, sad songs
I only smile in the dark
My only comfort is the night gone black
I didn't accidentally tell you that
You'll get the message by the time I'm through
When I complain about me and you
(Pour your misery down)
(Pour)
You can keep me company
As long as you don't care
You wanna hear about my new obsession?
I'm riding high upon a deep depression
(Pour some misery down on me)
One Two Three Four
If you think you can, well come on man
I was a Green Beret in Viet Nam
No more of your fairy stories
'Cause I got my other worries
53rd and 3rd
Standing on the street
I'm tryin' to turn a trick
You're the one they never pick
Don't make you feel sick ?
Then I took out my razor blade
Then I did what God forbade
Now the cops are after me
But I proved that I'm no sissy
Come on man
I'm a man baby
Your fairy stories
Have my other worries
We're a happy family
Me mom and daddy
Siting here in Queens
Eating refried beans
We're in all the magazines
Gulpin' down thorazines
We ain't got no friends
Our troubles never end
No Christmas cards to send
Daddy likes men
Daddy's telling lies
Baby's eating flies
Mommy's on pills
Baby's got the chills
I'm friends with the President
I'm friends with the Pope
We're all making a fortune
Selling Daddy's dope
I'm a shock trooper in a stupor
Yes I am
I'm a Nazi schatze
Why'know I fight for fatherland
Little German boy
Being pushed around
In a German town
In a German t...
Today your love, tomorrow the world
Leading on your deaths construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Obey your Master (master)
Obey your Master (Master)
Master Master
Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings
Just call my name, `cause I'll hear you scream
Master master master master master…..
Just labeled mentally deranged
No locked doors, No windows barred
Sleep my friend and you will see
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
And cannot breathe the open air
Sanitarium, just leave me the fuck alone
Reach motherfucker reach
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will Help you die
I will run through you
Now I'll rule you, too
Obey your Master
Master
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
Men on fire, still alive through the raging glow
It is the last time you will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see
I've got something to say
It doesn't matter much to me, as long as it's dead
It doesn't matter much to me, as long as she's spread
Sweet Lovely Death
Just waiting for your breath
Come sweet Death One Last Caress
One Last Caress
Hey man
Do your guesses ever know
Won't you kick me down some luck
Hey man, watch your language, motherfuck
Drown my enemies
Force inside of me
Roll
Dead Kennedy
Won't kick me down some luck
Watch your language motherfuck 
Watch your language motherfuck
Hye man
Watch your language motherfuckk
They do their best, they do what they can
They get them ready for Vietnam
From old Hanoi to East Berlin
Commando... Involved again
First rule is - The laws of Germany
Second rule is - Be nice to mommy
Third rule is - Don't talk to commies
Fourth rule is - Eat kosher salamis
Second rule is - Be nice to mo-mo-mo-mommy
Guilty as charged
But damn it, ain't right
There is someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
Ill take your life from you!
Now its time to die
I can feel the flames
No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We dont need to feel the sorrow
No remorse No repent
We dont give a shit what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No life till leather
We are gonna kick some ass tonight
When our fans start screaming
Its right well all right
We never want to stop again
Hit the lights
We are gonna blow this place away
Than anything today the only way
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack you face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
There is nothing you can do
The deafening waiting for his whips
Your bodies waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on you lips
Hear the cry of War
Louder than before
With this sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Your hear them crying death pains
The fists of terrors breaking through
Now theres nothing you can do
Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death
Fight fire with fire (repeat)
Man in black comes around
Blacks the light
Blacks the sound
Fear the thought of it never ever coming back
Leave the shift to the round
Open up your gate
Spirit dialate
Watch the falling sand
Shifting through his hand
Open Up Your Gate
Spirit Dialate
Whisper To Your Friends
Death Is Not The End!
Not the End
Its the beginning
It's a...
Paid my dues in the cell
Be the toll of the bell
Dearly beloved
We gathered here today
To say goodbye to our old selves
Slipping through his hand
Go tell all Your Friends
Its the begining
I've been a rambler, the light changes me
I've been a rambler, the light sets me free
Sets me free
*Guitar Solo*
I've been a rambler the light sets me free
I've been a gambler the light sets me free
Haha!
Go Tell all Your Friend
Death is not the end!

We're looking for you, to start up a fight
There's an evil feeling in our brains
But it's nothing new, you know it drives us insane
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
You always been taking and now you're giving
I feel uptight on a Saturday night
Nine o' clock, the radio's the only light
I hear my song and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do
I got to
Get up
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City
Getting late
I just can't wait
Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road
First I drink, then I smoke
Start up the car, and I try to make the midnight show
Movin' fast, doin' 95
Hit top speed but I'm still movin' much too slow
I feel so good, I'm so alive
I hear my song playin' on the radio
It goes
Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock
There's a truck ahead, lights starin' at my eyes
Oh my God, no time to turn
I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die
Why
We won’t need to intimidate you
If we get a major breakthrough
So come on – let it loose
You’ve all seen this all before
So come on, get up and off of the floor
Let’s go – let it loose
Oh yeah
We’re not here to read your rights
Tonight’s the night you do what you like
Hey you there – let it loose
If it’s much too loud, well, we don’t care
Are you ready – let it loose
Going crazy
We’ve the goods to appetise
Take it all, don’t compromise
Oh, Let it loose
Forget tomorrow, we’re here today
Is it what you want, are you here to stay
What do you say – let it loose
Now I wanna sniff some glue
Now I wanna have somethin' to do
All the kids wanna sniff some glue
All the kids want somethin' to do
1-2-3-4-
1-2-3..RIFF!!!
Yeah!!!
All the kids want somethin' to do..yeah
(Take that with you)
I'm looking through a hole in the sky
I'm seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie
I'm getting closer to the end of the line
I'm living easy where the sun doesn't shine
I'm living in a room without any view
I'm living free because the rent's never due
The synonyms of all the things that I've said
Are just the riddles that are built in my head
Hole in the sky, take me to heaven
Window in time, through it I fly
I've seen the stars disappear in the sun
The shooting's easy if you've got the right gun
And even though I'm sitting waiting for Mars
I don't believe there's any future in cause
I've watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast
I've seen the western world go down in the east
The food of love became the greed of our time
But now I'm living on the profits of pride
Recording
Never a rebirth
Evolution's end
Never will it mend
Oh Never
No Never
Fire, to begin whipping dance of the dead
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color my world blackened
Terminate its worth
Color my world blackened
Opposition
Contradiction
Premonition
Agitation
Violation
Mutilation
Termination
Expiration
Cancellation human race
Expectation
Liberation
Population laid to waste
Ohhh yeah
No no Never
Color my world
When our fans start screaming it's right
Well alright, yeah
We never wanna stop again
You know our fans are insane
We're gonna blow this place away
I run, but it stays right my side
So tear me open, pour me out
You feed it once, and now it stays
So tear me open, but beware
So wash me, until I'm clean
It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me
I don't want it
The things inside without a care
So wash me, 'till I'm clean...
So hold me, until it sleeps...
Until it sleeps...
There's no stoppin' the cretins from hoppin'
You gotta keep it beatin' for all the hoppin' cretins
Cretin! Cretin!
I'm gonna go for a whirl with my cretin girl
My feet won't stop doin' the Cretin Hop
1-2-3-4 cretins wanna hop some more
4-5-6-7 All good cretins go to heaven
You know I'm bad, the times I've had
I've gotta bad reputation
I don't care, I get my share
Don't feel no deprivation
The more I get the better it is
I like it fine, like a little whiz
Treat 'em like ladies, that's a fact
You know the chase is better than the catch
Silver tongued devil, demon leach
You know just what I'm doing
I like a little innocent bitch
You know I ain't just screwing
I love you baby, love you too much
I like you fine I feel your touch
But your appearance don't hold no class
A little beauty I love you madly
Come on home with me
I know you're hot, I know what you've got
You know I want to shake your tree
Come on honey touch me right there
Come on honey don't you get scared
Come on honey let me get you in the sack
If you see me riding by
Do not stop me, do not try
Cause we're all motorcycle men
We get our kicks just when we can
Motorcycle man
Like an angel slick machine
Were taking risks that's what we mean
Motorcycle, motorcycle
In your house
In your bed
Is he getting closer?
Are you running away?
Are you getting closer?
Can you stand up?
Another town, another place
Another girl, another face
Another truck, another race
Eatin' junk, feelin' bad
Another night, goin' mad
My Woman leavin' I'm so sad
But I just love the life I lead
Another beer is what I need
Another gig, my ears bleed
We are the road crew
Another town I've left behind
Another drink, completely blind
Another hotel I can't find
Another backstage pass for you
Another tube of superglue
Another border to get through
Drivin' like a maniac
Drivin' way to hell and back
Another room, a case to pack
Another hotel, we can burn
Another screw, another turn
Another Europe map to learn
Another truckstop on the way
Another game that I can play
Another word I learned to say
Another blasted customs post
Another bloody foreign coast
Another set of scars to boast
Standin' on a corner
Suitcase in my hand
Jack's in his corset, says to Jane, who's in her vest
Me, babe, I'm in a rock n' roll band
Friday night's a picture show
Those were different times
And the poets studied rules of verse
And all the ladies rolled their eyes
Sweet Jane
Now, Jack, he is a banker
And Jane, she is a clerk
And the both of them are saving up their money
Then they come home from work
Sittin' by the fire
Radio just played a little classical music for you kids
The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say
Some people like to go out dancing
And other people, they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you life is full of dirtAnd the women never really faint
And the villans always blink their eyes
And the children are the only ones who blush
'Cause life is just to die
But, anyone who has a heart
Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it
(Judas Priest cover)
Pounding the world like a battering ram
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
Hammering anvils straining muscle and might
Shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
Fast devastating and desolisating the curse
Blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth Wielding the axe comes the one culmination
That's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed
Sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage
Of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
Now grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled
Till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
The slipping and sliding corrosive subsiding That withered and wained till the world seemed all drained fills the bay
Second to none
They called us walking corpses
Unholy living dead
They had to lock us up
Put us in their British hell
Make sure your face is clean now
Can't have no dirty dead
All the corpses here are clean, boy
All the yanks in British hell
I don't wanna be here in your London Dungeon
I don't wanna be here in your British hell
Ain't no mystery why I'm in misery in Hell
Here's hoping you're free
Here's hoping you're swell
Deny
Cross your spine
(Ok that's good)
Cross your spine
So that gets broken too
Temptation wreck my head
Temptation make you dead
Temptation sucks through the sword
Temptation feel no more
Temptation wreck my head
Temptation make you dead
Temptation feel no more
So one man
Ah-ha
Temptation make you dead
Temptation sucks through the sword
Temptation feel no more
No no
Leave me alone
Say your prayers little one
Don't forget my son
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
'Til the sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
We're off to never-never land
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
Hush little baby don't say a word
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet in your head
Boo! Yeah yeah!
Oh poor twisted me
I chew on suffer
I chew on agony
And swallow whole the pain
Oh it's too good to be
All this misery
Is just for oh poor twisted me
Ooh yeah
I'm filled with sorrow
Once filled with misery
And hated the deep dark blue
Oh woe is me
Such a burden to bear
Poor mistreated me, yeah
Finally reached the shore
I survived the storm
Now you're feeling cold ever since he was born
Your pain is so over you
No more
Could ya be my friend?
Such a burden to see
You, you, poor twisted me
(Look)
How much hurt i'm in
(At)
Times times times like this
(My)
Got what's coming to
(Self)
Destructive aptitude
How much hurt i'm in
Times times times like this
I hear what goes on in the shadows of the cross
Why do I feel this haze?
I find lost people everywhere I are
Look
At
My
Self
I hear what goes on in the shadows of the cross
Faith of the unknown one
Wait, something must be done
So let it be written
I won't do it
I won't do it ({?])
I won't do it ({?])
I won't do it
I won't do it
I won't do it
Fuck that smile right off your face
Fuck that smile right off your face
Fuck that smile right off your face
More than this, nevermore your whipping boy
More than this, nevermore your whipping boy
More than this, nevermore your whipping boy
More than this, nevermore the whipping boy
More than this, nevermore the whipping boy
Dallas, you guys, you have some arms out there?
Thanks!
Let me see them!
This one's from the album "Ride The Lightning," maybe you can sing along
This one entitled "For Whom The Bell Tolls"
Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
On the fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
Sing it, Dallas!
Fuck yeah!
Now they see who will be, blinded eyes to see
Kirk
Kirk (Kirk)
[?}
Get down on it again
Welcome to where a time stands still
Moon is full, never seems to change
Labelled mentally deranged
I dream the same thing every night
See our freedom in my sight
Things to make my brain seem scarred
Dream is my reality
Cannot breathe the open air
Sanitarium, yeah
Leave me the fuck alone!
Reach out!
{Instrumental}
Yea-ha-ha-ah
No no no no no
Woah-oh
Oh no no
Woah
Yea-eh-ha-eh
Oh-ooh
Motherfucking yeah
No no no no no
No no no no no
Motherfucking yeah
When we start to rock
We never wanna stop again
Hit the lights!
Blackened is thе end
Dеath of Mother Earth
