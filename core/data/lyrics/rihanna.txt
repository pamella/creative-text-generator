You took my heart and my keys and my patience
You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation
All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been!
Mmmmm!

Long distance, I need you

If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly

Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'

You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the...

And you got me like, "Oh, what you want from me?"
(What you want from me?)
And I tried to buy your pretty heart, but the price too high
Baby, you got me like "Oh"
You love when I fall apart (fall apart)
So you can put me together and throw me against the wall
Baby you got me like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii, woo i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)

Just start loving me (loving me)
Owwwwww
And babe I’m fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe
And I run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That’s got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the brain yeah
And it keeps cursing my name
No matter what I do

Must be love on the..... brain
Baby keep loving me
Just love me

All you need to do is love me, yeah
Got me like, ah-ha-ha-owww

Baby like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii, woo i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii
Ooooooohhh
Must be love on the.... brain
Mustard on the beat, ho!
I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me
You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin' up
Light and roll it up
Break it down, like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real, on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I'll give it to ya
All along it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, “If you dare, come a little closer”
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
And I want you to stay
Ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving
Stay
Ooh
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Been waitin' on that sunshine, boy
I think I need that back
Can't do it like that
No one else gon' get it like that
So why argue? You yell, but cha take me back
Who cares, when it feels like crack?
Boy, ya know that you always do it right
Man, fuck yo pride
Just take it on back, boy, take it on back, boy
Take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back
Mmm, do what cha gotta do, keep me up all night
Hurtin' vibe, man, it hurts inside when I look you in yo eye
What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you’re willing to do
(Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)
Oh, what are you willing to do?
So why argue? You here, here to take me back
I’ve been waitin' up all night
Baby tell me what’s wrong?
You're gonna make it right, make it all night long
I’ve been waiting up all night
Baby, tell me, what’s wrong?
Going to make it right, make it all night long
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station
Vodka and water, and a lemon
And a few other things I cannot mention
Oh-na-na-na-na
Five fingers on it (five fingers)
Hit it like you own it, I’ma hit it like I’m on it
Straight shots of the blue dot
(Shots, shots, shots, shots)
Baby, I’ma pick your  poison
Oh-we, ah-yeah, you gon’ need it

I’ma get it wet like jacuzzi, ah-yea
And sex with me, so amazing
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me
So amazing, so amazing, mmmm
You know I got the sauce (sauce), you know I’m saucy
And it’s always wet, a bitch never ever had to use lip gloss on it
I’ma need you deeper than six, it's not a coffin
We’re not making love, tryna get nasty
Wrap up your drugs, come make me happy
Sex with me is amazing, with her it’ll feel alright
The sex doesn’t get any better, make it long, let it be all night
I know, I know, I make it hard to let go
Tonight, all night, I’m Monroe
Even if I’m alone
Sex with me so amazing
(This is the best there is)
Yayo, yayo
Mula-la
Yayo
Bitch better have my money
Y'all should know me well enough
Please don't call me on my bluff
Pay me what you owe me
Ballin' bigger than LeBron
Bitch, give me your money
Who y'all think y'all frontin' on?
Like bra, bra, bra
Louis XIII, and it's all on me, nigga, you just bought a shot
Kamikaze, if you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Shit, your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot
I call the shots, shots, shots
Pay me what you owe, don't act like you forgot
Bitch better have my (bitch better have my)
Turn up to Rihanna while the whole club fuckin' wasted
Every time I drop, I am the only thing y'all playin'
In a drop top, doin' hundred, y'all in my rearview mirror racin'
Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at?
Pay me what you owe me, don't act like you forgot
Bitch, bitch, bitch better have my money
Yo, that bitch better have my money
Hold up
My money
Yo, my money
That bitch better have my money
I came fluttering in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no
I know you've tried to
I came riding in on a pale white horse
Handing out highs to less fortunate
I do advise you
Run it back, run it on back
When you breaking it down for me
Cause I can't hear you, two times
Run it on back, will it ever make sense to me?
I got to do things my own way darling
Will you ever let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?
When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
I can't get no peace of mind
Let me cover your shit in glitter
I could make it gold, gold
Heard you tryna sell your soul, baby
Word on the street, you run it low lately
I needed you to please give my reflection a break
From the face it’s seeing now
Ooh darling, gahhlee
Would you mind giving my reflection a break
From the pain it’s feeling now?
Get no piece
Get no peace
Get, get, getting no peace
Can't get no peace
(Get, g-g-get no peace oh)
Shine bright like a diamond
Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight, I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes
So shine bright, tonight
You and I
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye
So alive
Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shinin' bright like a diamond
Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we'll never die
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
Oh-oh, yeah
Desperado
Sittin' in an old Monte Carlo
A man whose heart is hollow
Mhm, take it easy
I'm not tryna go against yuh
Actually, I'm goin' witcha
Gotta get up out of here
And yuh ain't leavin' me behind
I know you won't cause we share common interests
You need me, there ain't no leaving me behind
Never, no, no, I just want outta here, yeah
Once I'm gone, ain’t no going back
If you want, we can be runaways
Running from any sight of love
Yeah, yeah, there ain’t nothin'
There ain't nothin' here for me
There ain't nothin' here for me anymore
But I don't wanna be alone
Sitting on your ole' Monte Carlo
We've both had our hearts broke
Unh, hunh, take it easy
I can be a lone wolf witcha
And you ain't leaving me behind
Never, no, no, both want outta here, yeah
Once we're gone, ain’t no going back
Dear desperado
Yeah, I don't wanna be alone
Yeah-yeah-ah
I can just hear them now
"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
Worried 'bout every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
Well, I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
I finally know what it's like
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)
(I know there’s too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don’t know why it’s happening
(Stop while it’s not too late)
And I still don’t know
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
I don’t care I’m in love
So how do I know that it's right?
And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain’t so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
A realization is as good as it gets
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
(Stop before it's too late)
So how will I know I've gone too far?
And I know it's hard to describe
Oh na-na, what's my name?
Oh na-na, what's my name? (Uh)
What's my name? What's my name? (Yeah)
I heard you good with them soft lips
Yeah, you know, word of mouth
The square root of sixty-nine is eight somethin', right?
'Cause I've been tryna work it out, oh
Good weed, white wine, uh
I come alive in the night time, yeah
Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio
Let it play
Say you gotta leave, but I know you wanna stay
You just waitin' on the traffic jam to finish, girl
The things that we could do in twenty minutes, girl
Say my name, say my name, wear it out
It's gettin' hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as you go, the text that I write is gon' say
What's my name? What's my name?
Not everybody
Knows how to work my body
Knows how to make me want it
But, boy, you stay up on it
You got that somethin'
That keeps me so off balance
Baby, you're a challenge
Let's explore your talent
Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you
Can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Ooh, na, na, na, na
I need a boy to take it over
Lookin' for a guy to put in work
Oh woah, oh woah
Baby, you got me
And ain't nowhere that I'd be
Than with your arms around me
Back and forth, you rock me, yeah
So I surrender
To every word you whisper
Every door you enter
I will let you in
You're so amazing
You took the time to figure me out
That's why you take me
Way past the point of turnin' me on
You 'bout to break me
I swear you got me losin' my mind
Ain't nothin' wrong with it...
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
Love, love, love
Love and affection
Love, love
L-o-v-e-e-e and affection
Oh baby, I'm not asking for the world, maybe
You can give me what I want, baby
Come hold me tight and when I'm drowning, save me
Give it to me on a daily
If I'm your girl, say my name, boy
Let me know I'm in control
We both grown so how we feel we can let it show
I-I-I won't play around
I-I-I wanna lay you down
I-I-I need you now
I need you now, oh
Boy, lately you've been stingy with your time
Got me wondering
I'm wondering, If I'm on your mind
Boy, I just wanna be in your possession
Saying I'm the one you want
So come express it
Don't slip, don't slip
'Cause a nigga might push up on it
Don't really wanna lose this moment
Why window shop when you own this?
(I-I-I) Don't put it down
(I-I-I) Don't fuck around
(I-I-I) I want you now
I want you now, oh
[Verse 3: Future 
with Rihanna
]
Can you love me for poor?
I'm searching for my soul
Who ever turned you cold?
You need to let him know
I can work miracles
I'll work your physical
And when I love you close
You can feel my heart
Beating through my clothes
Future
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Yeah, Rihanna)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Good Girl Gone Bad)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Take three, action)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Hov)
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone, 
we Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather
, 
in G5's or better
You know me (You know me)
In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
Jay—Rain Man is back
With Little Miss Sunshine
, Rihanna, where you at?
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh
These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So gon' and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
It's rainin', rainin'
Ooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'
Baby, come here to me
You can always come into me
It's pourin' rain
Come here to me
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, 
but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs
 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it
This whiskey got me feelin' pretty
So pardon if I'm impolite
I just really need your ass with me
I'm sorry 'bout the other night
And I know I could be more creative
And come up with poetic lines
But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
Is the only thing that's in my mind
You take me higher, higher than I've ever been, babe
Just come over, let's pour a drink, babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late, too late
You light my fire
Let's stay up late and smoke a J
I wanna go back to the old way
But I'm drunk instead, with a full ashtray
With a little bit too much to say
Yeah, yeah
I ain't tryna think about it, no
Yeah, I said it, boy, get up inside it
I want you to homicide it
Go in slow, but I want you to pipe it
And I think I kinda like ya
Up against the wall, we don't need a title
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, bae
Yeah, I said it, man, fuck a title
Boy, I always like to show
Get a little bit, come a little close, now
Take it home on your camera phone
Get a little bad, nigga, watch me blow it down
You can be rough, boy, but you won't
Give me some love, boy, give it to me 'til the morn'
Yeah, I said it, babe
Yeah, I said it, uh
Nothing but a tear, that's all for breakfast
Watching you pretend you're unaffected
You're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go
But I won't
I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes
Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
Just say now, I'm coming right now to be close to you
Said you let it go, you kept it
Working hard to perfect it
But now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control
Well just let it go
Like so close, if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
If you let me, I'd be there by now
Woo
Woo, woo, yeah
Aw yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah
I bet she could never make you cry
‘Cause the scars on your heart are still mine
Tell me that she couldn't get this deep
She can almost be the worst of me
Too bad she's just eating off your dreams
Let me know when you're ready to bleed
Baby you just need to send for me
Send for me, send for me
I've been thinking 'bout you late at night
I've been thinking only of you
Ain't nothing else to really talk about
Boy show me what you want to do
These days you've been feeling lonely
Yeah I've been feeling lonely too
I'ma fuck it up, won't you show me some
Run it back like you owe me some
(Feel me up, feel me up)
Woo, yeah
(Feeling me, feeling me, feeling me up)
Tell me 'bout your picture-perfect love
Tell me how you think without the drugs
Maybe you just need to send for me
I don't mean to really love ya
I don't mean to even care about ya
I don't mean to really care about ya, no more
Woo (feel me up, feel me up)
Woo, woo, yeah (feel me up, feel me up)
(Send for me, send for me, send for me)
Woo (I don't mean to really love ya)
(No more, I don't mean to really care about ya, no more
I don't mean to really care about ya, no more)
Sak pasé!
I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight 'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry
'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why?
It's a twenty-two, I call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
What you expect me to do if you're playing me for a fool?
I will lose my cool and reach for my firearm
I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, ayy-uh
I just shot a man down (Would you hear me now?)
Look, I'd never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it, oh gosh
Whatever happened to me?
Ever happened to me?
Why did I pull the trigger, pull the trigger
Pull the trigger, boom
And end a nigga, end a nigga life so soon?
When mi pull the trigger, pull the trigger
Pull it pon' you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do? Eh
Mi say wah man down
A weh mi say
When mi went downtown
'Cause now I am criminal, criminal, criminal
Oh Lord, oh mercy, now I am a criminal
Tell the judge please gimme minimal
Run outta town, none a dem can see mi now, see mi now
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
Strip clubs and dolla' bills, I still got mo' money
Patron shots can I get a refill
I still got mo' money
Strippers going up and down that pole
And I still got mo' money
4 o'clock and we ain't going home, cause I still got mo' money
Money make the world go round, I still got mo' money
Bands make your girl go down,
 I still got mo' money
Lot more where that came from, I still got mo' money
The look in your eyes I know you want some
And I still got mo' money...
Oh ohh ohhh, ohhh oh-oh-oh
All I see is signs, all I see is dolla' signs
Money on my mind, money, money on my mind
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall out from the sky
Valet cost a hundred bill and I still got mo' money
Gold all up in my grill, I still got mo' money
Who cares how you haters feel and I still got mo' money
Call Jay up and close a deal, I still got mo' money
My fragrance on and they love my smell, I still got mo' money
So who cares about what I spend, I still got mo' money
My pockets deep and they never end, I still got mo' money
I'm going dumb with all my friends, I still got mo' money
Na-na-na, come on
Na-na-na-na-na, come on
Na-na-na, come on, come on, come on
Na-na-na-na, come on
Na-na-na-na
Feels so good being bad (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
There's no way I'm turning back (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now the pain is my pleasure 'cause nothing could measure
(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Love is great, love is fine (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Out the box, outta line (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it (Na-na-na)
S-S-S and M-M-M
Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say, "Ah-ah-ah"
Oh
Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I separate from here and now
A drug and a dream
A lost connection, oh, come back to me
So I can feel alive again
As soul and body try to mend
It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never-ending
I slipped into a parallel
They'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
Why does it have to feel so strange
To be in love again, be in love again, be in love again?
I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
What now?
I just can't figure it out
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? Oh-oh-oh-ohh
I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love, but I'm numb again
It's just sitting there laughing at me
What now? (Please tell me)
There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout
What now? (Somebody tell me)
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
So what now?
It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when its over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
I'd rather be smoking weed whenever we breathe
Every time you kiss me
Don't say that you miss me
Just come get me
Don't know why, just know I want to
Don't know why, just know I want you
I'd rather be breaking things, cause we can't see
We're too busy kissing
Just making scenes
here come the police
They know about your history
How you live and love like "fuck rules"?
Don't care why, just know I love you
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Stir it up, porridge
Getting dope, so rich
Ah smoke it
And I ain't never liked a broke bitch
I don't never fuck with ya hoe bitch
Quiet down
Oh-oh-oh shit
So-oh-oh rich
Eyes low , I'm so loaded
Eyes, pose bitch
Take it off
Wanna see you work it like oh my god
And that thang is out I know you know
And you bounce it like I know you know

And if you with it go fuckin loco, loco
Oh, how about a round of applause?
Yeah, a standing ovation
Ooh, whoa, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out
And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Really had me going
But now it's time to go (Ooh, oh)
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
(Oh-oh)
Grab your clothes and get gone (Get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (Come on)
Talking' bout' "Girl, I love you, you're the one"
This just looks like the re-run
Please, what else is on? (Ooh, oh)
And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not (Mmm)
Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you (Goes to you)
For making me believe
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
How 'bout a round of applause?
A standing ovation
Now it's time to go (Ooh, oh)
But it's over now
Please don't stop the music (Music, music, music, music)
It's gettin' late, I'm making my way over to my favorite place
I gotta get my body moving, shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate, yeah
Who knew that you'd be up in here lookin' like you do
You're making stayin' over here impossible
Baby, I'ma say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't
Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now we're face to face
I wanna take you away, let's escape into the music, DJ, let it play
I just can't refuse it, like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the, please don't stop the music
Baby, are you ready? ’Cause it's getting close
Don't you feel the passion ready to explode?
What goes on between us, no one has to know
This is a private show, oh
[Bridge: Michael Jackson & 
Rihanna
Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa
Please don't stop the music
[Outro: Michael Jackson & 
Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul, 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
Whoa
Anymore
And every time I walk out the door
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna be, a murderer
A murderer, no, no, no
Yeah
Come here, rude boy, boy, can you get it up?
Come here rude boy, boy, is you big enough?

Part I: Love Without Tragedy
Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low
Dean on the low
I ask you, "What's the matter?"
You say "Oh, it's nothing at all."
Heart's racing outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice
What's love without tragedy?
(
Marilyn Monroe
)
Part II: Mother Mary
Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name
As time flies way above me
For you, I've cried, tears ceding
Oh glory, the prayers carry me
I'll be a star, you keep directing me
Let's make the best scene they've ever seen
Let's capture the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
Let's live by the moment
To die in the moment
Die the moment
Ecstasy in the air
I don't care
Can't tell me nothing
I'm impaired
No worse for wear
'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going
Can’t you see?
Ain’t it clear
Get closer to me
If you dare
I double dare
I’m plastered (dry wall)
Look me in my (eyeball)
Do I look high? (no!)
I love the way you lie girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come here dear
I'm tryna get closer to you
I'm motionin' you to pull over, boo
I'm the siren that you hear (hear)
I'm the butt police and I'm lookin' at your rear, rear, rear
But odds are I'ma end up in the back of a squad car
By the end of tonight, I'm a rock star
Get your wind up, it's attack of the oddball
Homie can you show me where the gosh darn bath salts are
'Cause I'm sick of sniffin' asphalt
Every thought scarred got my pants off at the crosswalk
In suspenders and I can't feel my lips 'cause—
Baby, baby, when we first met
I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped into one, with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden, you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shot that spun me around and now my heart left
I feel so empty and hollow
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
And now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it (Do it)
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease
Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?
You'll do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me, I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way that I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
You gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you
'Cause now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I should've never let you enter my door (Let you enter my door)
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed (Using like I bleed)
It's like I checked into rehab (Oh)
Baby, you're my disease (You're my disease)
I gotta check into rehab (Oh)
'Cause baby, you're my disease (You're my disease)
Now ladies, gimme that
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, now gimme that
Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la (Uh, yeah)

Be thinking of me (Uh)
Doing what you like (Haha)
So, boy, forget about the world
'Cause it's gon' be me and you tonight (Yeah)
I wanna make you beg for it
Then I'ma make you swallow your pride, oh (Uh, uh)
Want you to make me feel
Lke I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command
'Cause I'm the only one who understands
How to make you feel like a man, yeah
Like I'm the only girl in the world
Only one
Want you to take it (Uh)
Like a thief in the night (Uh)
Hold me like a pillow
Make me feel right (Uh)
Baby, I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keeping
You can come inside (Yeah)
And when you enter, you ain't leaving
Be my prisoner for the night, oh
Take me for a ride, ride
Oh, baby, take me high, high
Let me make you rise, rise
Oh, make it last all night, night
Make it last all night
How to make you feel like a man
Girl in the world
Tell me that you love me, when you know you don't love me
But I guess, I guess, I guess it's all good
You can play the game, I'ma still do my thing
Ain't no better way for it to be put
When you fuck them other girls
I bet they be wondering why you always call my name
You think I'm gonna wait around, I ain't got all day
You don't need another lover
Don't you let it go
I already got it covered
Let the others know
If you want it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle is waiting
Come and jump on it
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Think I give a damn
Boy, don't you know who I am?
I ain't running 'round chasing no dude
Think somebody else like me gone come around?
Boy, you got it misunderstood
Put it in your face, but you acting all scared
Like you can't recognize a good thing
Now that you got a chance, tell me, what it's gon' be?
You say it's my fault
Okay, I get it
You ain't pick up your calls
I'm like, "forget it"
See you put up your wall
You know you did it
The rise and the fall
Just admit it
You ain't answer your calls
It's the the rise and the fall
And you could have had it all
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
(What's wrong with me?)
(Why do I feel like this?)
(I'm goin' crazy now)
No more gas in the rig (Can't even get it started)
Nothin' heard, nothin' said (Can't even speak about it)
All my life on my head (Don't wanna think about it)
Feels like I'm goin' insane, yeah
It's a thief in the night to come and grab you (Aha!)
It can creep up inside you and consume you (Aha!)
A disease of the mind, it can control you  (Aha!)
It's too close for comfort, ah
Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise
Your mind's in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia, am I scarin' you tonight?
Your mind's in disturbia, ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia
Faded pictures on the wall
It's like they talkin' to me
Disconnected, no one calls
The phone don't even ring
I gotta get out, or figure this shit out
It's too close for comfort, oh
A disease of the mind, it can control you (Aha!)

Disturbia, ain't used to what you like
The mood is set (Huh, huh)
So you already know what's next (Uh-huh, ah)

I hit a wall, I never felt so low, so low
Like a waterfall, my tears dropped to the floor, the floor
They left a swimming pool of salted crimes, crimes
Oh, what could I do to change your mind?
Nothing
I'm bracing for the pain and I am letting go
I'm using all my strength to get out of this hole
I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all, watch the fall
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
Yeah I hit a wall, I prayed that I would make it through, make it through
I can survive a life that's without you, that's without you, yeah
And I will rise up from the ashes now, the ashes now
Oh, the sparrow flies with just the crumbs of loving spilled, yeah
I was bracing for the pain and then I let it go
I gathered all my strength and I found myself whole
Talk that talk to me, yeah
I be tryna chill, bitches wanna fuck me
Every little city I go, "Fuck me!"
Shawty must’ve heard, got the word, I move that D
Had it by her bladder, she like, “Oh, I gotta pee!” Hahaha

Million dollar voice, came through phone
We heading to the top, if you coming, come on

Talk, talk that talk to me, yeah
Take a breath, take it deep
"Calm yourself," he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)
Say a prayer to yourself
He says, "Close your eyes
Sometimes it helps"
And then I get a scary thought
That he’s here, means he’s never lost
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger
As my life flashes before my eyes
I’m wondering, will I ever see another sunrise?
So many won’t get the chance to say goodbye
But it’s too late to think of the value of my life
Ouh-oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving, no
You can see my heart beating
I’m terrified but I’m not leaving, no, no
Only if for a night

Just get up on my body, I'll do anything...
Te amo, te amo
She says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over
Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is 
awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
She's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water
I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over
My soul is awry
Listen, we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night
I’m moving through the light
Because I understand
That we all need love
And I'm not afraid
To feel the love, but I don't feel that way
Suck my cockiness, lick my persuasion
Eat my words and then swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs over your resistance
And then you come around, you come around, you come around
I want you to be my sex slave
Anything that I desire
Be one with my femin-ay
Set my whole body on fire
Fair maiden Rihannagate
Taking over your empire
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'm gonna be the queen of your body parts
No one can do you the way that I do
Boy, I want (You)
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it
I can be your dominatrix
Just submit to my every order
Enter my diamond matrix
If you want my golden flower
Make me your priority
Place nothing above my pleasure
Hold it down, beat it like a bully
Beat my drum, drum, like a drumline boogie (I love it when you)
Dive head first if you wanna
Sing to my body, hold me tight Mr. Lover (I love it when you)
Do it like I do it, like I said
Keep it up, boy, we can do this all day
Be my Harlem and me St. Tropez
Never found nobody that will do it this way
Boy, I want (Youuuuuu)
It's dark in the day
I'll say now don't complain
Look up, the sun is just a cloud away
You're so afraid to cry
But your heart be feeling dry
It's time to change
But you keep thunderin', thunderin'
I'm wonderin', wonderin' why you keep thunderin'
Won't you just rain?
And get it over with
When I feel the pain
Now, babe, I won't complain
I hear you say, "Look up, the sun is just a cloud away"
And now we're so afraid to cry
When you need a wave to ride, that's the way
You keep thunderin', thunderin'
Won't you just fucking rain?
I see you rolling it
Let's get it over with
Get high and float again
Roll up and go again
It's alright
We can roll In the clouds
Getting high
We can float in the clouds
We can roll in the clouds
We can roll on the clouds
Keep thunderin', thunderin'
Won't you fucking just rain?
We should be lighting it up
Started with a lighting
It's dark in the day now
Say now don't complain
Chest to chest (Chest to chest)
Nose to nose (Nose to nose)
Palm to palm
We were always just that close (Just that close)
Wrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)
Toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
Eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Cheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me (Oh, next to me)
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us?
Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then, my eyes got wetter
So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Been California wishing on these stars
You'll always be mine
Sing it to the world
You'll always be my boy
I'll always be your girl
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
Mine and my baby
But mine and my baby (ooh)
I love to, love to, love you, baby
I love to, love to, love you, baby (Woo, woo)
Me and you, get it? (Woo, woo)
Said it, it ain't nobody's business (Woo, woo)
Your love is perfection
Please point me in the right direction
I'ma give you all my affection
Every touch becomes infectious
Let's make out in this Lexus
There's no other love just like this
A life with you
I wonder, can we become love's persona?
You'll always be the one that I wanna come home to, boy
Let me love you and show you how special you are
I wanna be your baby, you'll always be my baby
Tell me what you want now
You'll sing it to the world
Baby, give me time

And I wanna make you mine
And it ain't nobody's business
It ain't nobody's business
It ain't nobody's business but mine and my baby
Ooh, ooh

And it ain't nobody's business (No)
It ain't nobody business (No)

It ain't nobody business just mine and my baby
It ain't no (ah), it, it, it ain't no
It, it, it ain't no, it ain't no (ah-ah-ah-ah)
Ain't nobody business
Said it ain't nobody's business
It ain't nobody's business (Ain't nobody)
You'll always be mine (Mine)

You'll always be my boy (Woo)
You'll always be my girl, yeah
Ain't nobody's business (Nobody's business)
Ain't nobody's business (Ain't nobody's business)
Ain't nobody's business (Nobody)

Come and charge him with the 1-4-3, yeah
Told me this world was mine
Such a beautiful lie
Now it's done, done, done
And his love is no more for me
Hand in the air as he waved me goodbye
He say he care, but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga, is you blind?
Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fi-Fo-Fum, like the sky is falling down on me
Numb-numb-numb
He so cold, he doesn't feel a thing
Broken heart was the case
Go on and put him away
He's the only one-one-one I ever let get the best of me
Usually I'm the one that they cry for
But this man, he's the one that I'd die for
Mama said there's no 'cause for a rebel
Do you hear me now?
No love, no love, no love allowed

Run through your town, I'll shut it down
Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from 27 million
And I want it all, it's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got, I need it all
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that
All on me like that, yeah
I see you aiming at my pedestal
So I think I gotta let you know
Go hard or go home, back to your residence
Soon as the Red Dogs give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my whole block like Obama and them
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma and them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em "give me back my swag!" They tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me, "Louis Mane"?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be
Where them girls talking trash? Where them girls talking trash?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where them bloggers at? Where them bloggers at?
Where your lighters at? Where your lighters at?
I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cheers to the freakin' weekend

Oh, let the Jameson sink in
Don't let the bastards get you down
Turn it around with another round
There's a party at the bar
Everybody, put your glasses up and I drink to that
I drink to that
Life's too short to be sitting 'round miserable
And people gon' talk whether you doing bad or good, yeah
Got a drink on my mind and my mind on my money, yeah
Looking so bomb, gonna find me a honey
Got my Ray-Bans on and I'm feeling hella cool tonight, yeah
Everybody's vibing, so don't nobody start a fight, yeah
'Bout to hop on the bar, put it all on my card tonight, yeah
Might be mad in the morning, but you know we goin' hard tonight
It's getting Coyote Ugly up in here, no Tyra
It's only up from here, no downward spiral
And I drink to that
Cheers to the freaking weekend
That's how much I love you (Yeah)
That's how much I need you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)
But you won't let me
You upset me, girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (That I was upset)
Can't remember what you did
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you
And I hate how much I love you, boy (Yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (Oh, whoa)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (Oh)
You completely know the power that you have (Power that you have)
The only one makes me laugh (Makes me laugh)
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I... (I)
Love you beyond the reason why (Why)
And it just ain't right, oh
And I hate how much I love you, girl (Ooh)
I can't stand how much I need you (Yeah)
And I hate how much I love you, girl
But I just can't let you go (Ooh)
But I hate that I love you so
One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me (Hmm)
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Ooh, oh, oh
That's how much I love you
How much as I need you
How much I need you
How much I love you
Oh, I need you
That's how much I need you
I need you
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
(I can't stand how much I need you)
(But I just can't let you go, no)
And I hate that I love you so (Ooh)
And I hate that I love you so, so
I've been everywhere, man, looking for someone
Someone who can please me, love me all night long
I've been everywhere, man, looking for you babe
Looking for you babe, searching for you babe
Where have you been?
'Cause I never see you out
Are you hiding from me, yeah?
Somewhere in the crowd, oh
All my life, all my life
Where have you been all my life?
Where have you been all my li—
I've been everywhere, man, looking for you, babe
Looking for you babe, searching for you baby
Where have you been all my li-i-i-i-ife?
Where have you been all my li-i-i-i—?
Y-You
You can have me all you want
Any way, any day
Just show me where you are tonight, oh yeah, oh
Won’t say a thing
About the way you love me
Except for, I like the way
I love the way you touch me
If I toot it, leave it tooted up
Then I drop it, drop it
Till ya making faces
And look like you wanna
Tell me stop it
Imma do it, do it, do it
Till you can't take no more
Till my lipstick ain't up on my face no more
I’mma do it do it do it
On the bed, on the floor, on the couch
Only 'cause your lips ain't make it to my mouth
Just because I can’t kiss back
Doesn’t mean you can’t kiss that
Oh, baby, baby, just like that
Slow, baby, baby, just like that
Oh, baby, baby, turn me out
Oh, baby, baby, it's your turn now
It’s your turn now, it’s your turn now
Watch and learn now, watch and learn how
Watch and learn now, eh-eh-eh
Oh, baby, baby
If you learn now, if you learn now
If you learn how, I’ll stay
Don’t ask me if
You were the first to sleep here
'Cause if he did, you wouldn’t even be here
Come put my love against your kiss (oh, na-na-na)
La-la-la, just like this
Na-na, don’t be shy
Baby, all I need
Oh, do it on me
Like you aim to please
Show me how much you mean it
By the way you please me, baby
I've been lookin' for a driver who is qualified
So if you think that you're the one, step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangsta lean
So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go
Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night
‘Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)
I've got class like a '57 Cadillac
Got overdrive with a whole lot of boom in the back
You look like you can handle what's under my hood
You keep saying that you will, boy, I wish you would
Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for
‘Cause your Maybach, ain't got what I got (Get it, get it)
Don't stop, it's a sure shot
And your Ferrari, huh boy, I'm sorry
I ain't even worried, so step inside and ride
(Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride)
Shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive)
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Lost in the rock and roll
Got lost in a promise of a love I'd never know
 (Ooh)
Shadows chased me far from home
I remember when my heart was filled with gold
And you know
I've been burned, I've been burned, I've been burned
You've seen me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth my soul
Lost my faith and trust
You and I know gold don't turn to rust
 (Ooh-ooh)
I still swear that we can reign
Like the kings and queens of better yesterdays
Don't you know
Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna run to, when you get to the edge of the night?
Its time you face the sky, ooh
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
(You know, I've never felt like this before) Oh, oh
(This feeling's like... so real) Oh, oh
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressin', incessantly pressin' the issue
'Cause every moment gone, you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close boy, 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me callin' out for help
S-O-S, please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard
I can't take it, see, it don't feel right
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night
This time please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testin' me, but still, I'm losin' it
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it
Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots
 and when I see you, it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (Uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels (Over heels)
Boy, you keep me hangin' on, the way you make me feel
Y-O-U are makin' this hard (Y-O-U are)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it ('Cause you on my mind)
This time please, someone come and rescue me (Someone come and rescue me)
Boy, you know you got me feelin' open
And boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said boy, I'm tellin' you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm goin' crazy over you, I'm beggin'
Y-O-U are makin' this hard (Why you makin' this hard for me, baby?)
You got me tossing and turning, can't sleep at night
This time please, someone come and rescue me (Someone rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it (All of the time)
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it (Best of me, I'm losin' it )
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now
Baby, tonight I need you
And I feel it when I see you
Wherever you wanna go
Whenever, baby, I'm yours
So close, I can taste you
Ain't scared, I can take you
Can't fight the feeling
Got me fiendin'
You got me fiendin'
Something you wanted to do all your life
There's no more waiting, tonight is the night
And it can't be wrong, not if it feels this right
Turn it up
Scream it loud, yeah
Stupid in love
Let me tell you something
Never, have I ever, been a size ten in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see, what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mmm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid
My new nickname is "You Idiot" (Such an idiot)
Mmm, that's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me "Let go, he is not the one"
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
Telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist on repeatedly tryna tell me lies
And I just don't know why
Tryna make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on (Oh)
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you won't realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb?
Oh, no, no, no
I'm not stupid in love
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid in love
You saw me on a television
Setting fire to all the buildings
Yeah, I guess you saw me stealing
But you've no idea what I've been needing
Talk about when we were children
Not the kind of kid you believe in
Saw me on a television
But that's just the half of it
Yeah, you saw the half of it
This is the life I live
And that's just the half of it
Hanging out my dirty linen
You're entitled to your own opinion
Sit and shake your head at my decisions
I guess the kind of songs that I've been singing
Make it seem as if I'm always winning
But you saw me on a television
Yeah, you saw me on a television
You saw the half of it
Oh, you know me
I'm the life of the party
Beautiful people surround me
Everybody fallin' in love
Everybody knows that I'm crazy
Sticks and stones, they never break me
And I'm the type that don't give a fuck
Yeah, this is the life I live
And this is the life I live
Only the... half of it
Yeah, whoa
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo
Catch a playa by the toe
If you want to, let him go
Ladies, don't worry 'cause they got plenty more
Men be fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Oh, it's rainin' men, girl, what you worried 'bout?
Who you think you getting with that "Hi, let me freak ya"?
You got me mistaken thinking you gon' get it easy
First of all, you need to know that I'm not the one
Think you gettin' somethin', baby, you ain't gettin' none
All you need to know that I'm a two times five
Load it, cock it, aim it, baby, boom bye-bye
Set your standards lower, boy, you're aimin' too high
Matter of fact, your friend looks better, so goodbye
Oh woah, woah
Oh woah, woah, woah
Excuse me, but who are you fixin' to be?
Let them motherfuckers know there's plenty fish in the sea
And he sweatin' me just 'cause I got the tightest hole
But I couldn't find that-that thing with a microscope (Oh)
Give me dome, dome, da-da-da-da-da-dome, dome, dome
I ain't trippin' on your money, money, long, long, long
Want my own TV production company
So tell Harpo to hit me, Celie
Anyway, RiRi, what rhymes with your name freely?
Money got you vacationing in Chile
Do you wanna sit on the back while I wheelie?
Really? Really? No, for real, really?
Laid out on the beach, they be feeding me my catfishes
'Cause it's raining men, fat bitches
I said ayy, outta my way, where my ladies?
Ridin' big, living good, doin' big things
Dancin' don't pay
Player, keep the money, I can buy my own drink
Up in the club (Ayy)
See men coming, dime a dozen
So it don't mean nothin' to me (Ayy)
And I ain't even worried about you, homie
'Cause there’s plenty more fish in the sea (Okay)
Know I'm missin' that kissin' in the rover
Boy, what I'm feelin', never feel it about another
I need you, why can't you come over?
And you my lover, but I love you like a brother
Babe, you the one at the end of the day
You are who you are and I love you that way
Lust ain't love, if you know the difference
You got a little game on ya, caught up in your feelings
We together like..
You know that I'mma do whatever, I'm not gon' leave (Oh, yeah, yeah)
This kind of love don't come easy (Ah, yeah, yeah)
We don't care what they think, babe
Promise we'll stay the same
Say that you'll stay right here for me
See, I know you like being 'round chicks
And looking at her hips, and a little outfit
What can I say? (What can I say?)
That's what I love about you, babe (That's what I love about you, babe)
Yeah, I don't ask, 'cause I know you gon' lie
You're way too sexy, to ever be shy
(Go ahead)
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Go ahead
You the shit
Yeah, baby, you the bomb
Middle of the day, give me what I want
It feels so special, it feels so good
And he ain’t goin' no where even if he could
I got that ow, ow
You know what I’m talkin' about, 'bout
Make a nigga scream and shout, shout
Everytime the lights go out, out
We out, out
Fuck what you think, babe
That's what I love about you, babe (hat's what I love about you, babe)
Ah, and I know what you're thinking of
That I don't know a thing about love
But what I know is I'm his girl
And he's the one for me
See, this shit ain't worth tripping over
Do your thing, it doesn't matter
As long as we gon' rock forever
Love is all we need
Hey, what can I say? (What can I say?)
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
How do I take it off if I love at all?
It's like a work of art
In love, we all will fall, but
We fell a little harder
It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise
I'm so lost in paradise
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise
How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody told me how to mend
A broken hearted soul
I'm so lost in paradise (Lost in paradise)
All my fears are gone tonight
Lost in paradise
I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got that whole "in love" thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time, it didn't mean a thing
My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
Did it happen when we first kissed?
'Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me, baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart
How did I get here with you?
I'll never know
I never meant to let it get so personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken hearted, I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry (Cry, cry, cry)
When you walked out of my life (You'll never see me cry)
All my life
Red lipstick, all on the paper
Lemme take a hit while you sit and watch
Go 'head, talk shit, it's all in the papers
Lemme grab my dick while you sit on top
Do ya right here while the whole world's watchin'
All up in my mental, gotta get up in my physical
Don't know what you did
But you really got me feeling
That feeling tonight
All on you, babe
'Cause you really got me feeling
I want you, babe
Got me going cray
'Bout to let it blow, let it go
Just show me where you want me, baby
Can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah
(What I like, can't lie)
I just can't fight the feeling
(Do whatever you like)
(You're gonna learn tonight, oh)
We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (Don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim
Patron on brain, ball player in her face
They shake the spot, she's just another case
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever
He's staying with a flock of them, oh yeah
Got a girl at home, but he don't care
Won't care (Won't care)
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be gettin' it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop it's
Getting out of control, finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh
And left us all alone, oh
Don't need a reason, don't need a reason
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We done forever
We gone forever
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Sometimes, I get you
Sometimes, I don't understand
Sometimes, I love you
Sometimes, it's you I can't stand
Sometimes, I wanna hug you
Sometimes, I wanna push you away
Most times, I wanna kiss you
Other times, punch you in the face
'Cause every minute, you start switching up
And you say things like you don't give a fuck
Then I say I'm through with you, take my heart from you
And you come running after me, and baby, I'm back with you, oh
Sometimes, I catch you
Sometimes, you get away
Sometimes, I read you
Other times, I'm like, "Where are you on the page?"
Sometimes, I feel like we will be together forever
But you're so complicated, my heart knows better
I'ma stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure that you're really sure
You like sleeping alone
No
I feel like I’m a hopeless romantic
I can’t help falling in love
I fiend for love
I want it, I crave it
I just can’t get enough
Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I may be a little naive, yeah
You know I’m drunk on love, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It’s all that I need
I've been let down
But never been tainted
So I stay thirsty for more
No, I won't hold back
No drop is wasted
I'll let love run its course
You know I’m drunk on love
Drunk, drunk on love
I'm so intoxicated
I love the way you taste on my lips, when we kiss
You got me so addicted
So much, I can't resist falling into your arms
You have my hands to hold
So how come you won't hold me?
Your words are so damn cold
The winter can't affect me
You're man enough to say
What you think is my business
But, you can't say you love me
Even in between the kisses
Tender, tender little kisses you give to me
Just like you give to her, tell me how can you sleep?
Teardrops, little teardrops fallin' in disbelief
How can you lie to her, while you lay with me?
Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can't find the words to say
But, if you don't have an answer
Your arms around me now
Felt like sunlight in the morning
It always comes around
But, just not when I want it
So all you have to give
Is everything I needed
But, it's so hard to live
Just wonderin' if you're givin'
You'd rather make up a lie
Then make up a fight
And then you get so upset when I ask you why, oh
I wonder what makes you feel
A part of you can't be real
You said you'd never hurt me
Then, what do you think you did?
(Come on) I wanna dance in the dark
(Come on) We gonna light up the night
Underdogs dance in the middle of the night
Can see the night skies in the mirror of your eyes
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
I wanna run wild in the middle of the night
Right under the moon, bodies glowing in the night
Nothing in between our skins but the rhythm
The night-time is the right time
I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed
Move move move
Dancing in the dark
Out here with the stars like the creatures of the night
I wanna dance fast in the middle of the night
And see the night skies in the mirror of your eyes
I wanna dance in the dark (come on)
We gonna light up the night (come on)
We gonna light up the night
I told ya, I told ya
I told ya baby, baby
Uh, uh, I told ya, baby
Uh oh
Uh, uh, I told ya
Got up in the club, posted in the back
Feeling so good, looking so bad
Rocking this skirt, rocking this club
Got my middle finger up, I don't really give a fuck
Rocking these diamonds, I'm rocking this chain
Make sure you get a picture, I'm rocking my fame
To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar
I'm a rockstar (Rockstar)
Hey baby, I'm a rockstar (Rockstar)
Hey baby
Big cities (Big cities)
Bright lights (Bright lights)
Sleep all day (All day)
Long nights
Baby, I'm a rockstar (Rockstar)
Hey baby, it's big cities (Big cities)
Long nights (Long nights)
Baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Hey, hey, hey
Six-inch walker, big shit talker
I never play the victim, I'd rather be a stalker
So baby take me in, I'll disobey the law
Make sure you frisk me good
Check my panties and my bra
Wild'n out, a crazy house
With my white jacket on
Won't you come and sign me out?
Hey
I'm rocking out tonight
'Cause I can't wait 'til tomorrow
I'ma live my whole life in the night
'Cause I ain't got time to borrow
Why wait 'til tomorrow
Ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die, we die
It's 'til the day that we die
It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
I'm thinking about everything that we've become, and I hate it
I thought we could make it, but I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures and the letters she sent
You had me thinking you were out wit' your friends
I'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh
Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why, but this is what you said
We ride
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
Visions in my mind of the day that we met
You showed me things that I'll never forget
Took me swimming, in the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating, yeah
You think I'm playing when you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses and my loving
But ain't nobody better than us
And I just can't figure out why, but you said
I guess it’s over indefinitely
But you and I know it’s not that easy to let go
Of everything, that we planned
And start all over again, hey
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won’t forget how you do it
My sweet baby, this is where the game ends now
Somehow
Wanna believe you and me, we can figure it out, oh
Til we die
Gonna make me say, boy
I wish that you could hold me when I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to, you would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)
Boy, you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
It's 'til we die
On my roof
Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof
I'm torn apart and you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold case love
And I let you reach me one more time
But that's enough
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes
Couldn't see (No)
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind you can keep
Release me now 'cause I did my time
Of this cold case love
My heart's no longer cold and confined
I've had enough
We lost our way
Took this too far
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart
We've lost enough
Looking for a truth
That was here all along
Love
Mama, I found a man
Who loves me and understands
Papa, he's quite a man
He adores me, he's my biggest fan
And don't get me wrong
I know he's not perfect in your eyes
But somehow he's flawless in mine
And you may tell me to run, run now
But I can't do that
We're too far down the hole
He's got a hold on my soul
So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till I've had enough
Mama, don't judge me now
I'm not trying to hurt you
I know this won't make you proud
Papa, did I let you down?
Are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?
You'll see a monster
I see a smile
You say it's danger
And I'm in denial
But somehow I feel so safe right now
There could be a freak accident
There could be a fatal disease
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
It's as real as you and me
We could all fall down
Before our savior could return
If I should go
Hold my hand
If I should leave
Darling, cover me, please
The earth could quake to ruin
We could drift off in our sleep
The ocean crushed the shore
And take us down forever more
Darling cover me, please
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn
The wait is over, the wait is over
I pitch with a grenade
Swing away if you're feeling brave
There's so much power in my name
If you pop off and you say it
Stadium gon' do the wave
I'm such a fucking lady
You don't have to be so afraid
'Cause I got room up on my team
You can play but hold up
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble, that's a flag on the play
Babe, if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together, we gon' be taking over
It's just the way
The game is played
It's best if you just
Wait your turn
So you don't wanna wait?
I hate to hear that, such a shame
'Cause if you play it sideways, ain't no timeout in my game
They already underway
I know you want to win
And you wish I would let you in
Get in line over here
Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Couldn't be with no one else, you're the only way I'll win
Baby got the whole world standing up
Damn, I'm glad I picked ya, took a chance on love
Babe, you're up
The time is now and now the wait is over
Just wait your turn
Wherever you're going
I wanna go
Wherever you're headed
Can you let me know?
Don't mind catching up
I'm on my way
Just can't take the thought of you miles away
And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life
I hope that you find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know it'll be sadder
If you never hit the road
So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody's me
I will write to tell you what's going on
But you won't miss nothing but the same old song
If you don't mind catching up
I'll spend the day telling you stories about a land far away
But I know
And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life (oh)
And I'm gon' try to hold it all in
Try to hold back my tears
So it don't make you stay here, yeah
I'mma try to be a big girl now
'Cause I don't wanna be the reason you don't leave
I wanna let you know
That you don't have to go
Don't wonder no more
What I think about you
Now, if it's lovin' that you want
Then you should make me your girl, your girl
If it's lovin' that you need
Baby, come and share my world, share my world, oh
If it's lovin' that you want
Come and take a walk with me, walk with me
'Cause everything that you need, I got it right here baby, baby
Now it's obvious you need a friend to come hold you down
Be that one you share your everything when no one's around
Baby, come tell me your secrets, and tell me all your dreams
'Cause I can see you need someone to trust
You can trust in me
Di-di-di-di-da-da-dey
So just call me whenever you're lonely
I'll be your friend, I can be your homie
Baby, come and share my world, share my world
It's been so long
I've had this feeling that we could be
Everything you've ever wanted, baby
Your fantasy
I won't push too hard or break your heart, 'cause my love's sincere
I'm not like any other girl you know
So let me erase your fears
Come and take a walk with me, walk with me, baby
'Cause everything that you need, I got it right here, baby
Then you should make me your girl (Make me your girl, baby), your girl
Baby, come and share my world (I got what you need, so come share my world), share my world
Come and take a walk with me, walk with me (Come and take a walk with me)
'Cause everything that you need, I got it right here, baby, baby
What I think about you, boy
I got what you need so come share my world, oh
No, no
I lick the gun when I'm done
'Cause I know that revenge is sweet
So sweet
This is a gang, ladies thang
Baby bang, tell me what you need, oh
Any motherfucker wanna disrespect
Playing with fire finna get you wet
How it feel down there on your knees
I got this
Girls like a soldier
Trip and it's goin' down, down, down
I'm ready to roll
Girl, I'm with you
If they get you, they get me
So come on, let's go
Bitch, I'm with you
If you with it, you with me
You know I'm down
Down for life
Load it, reload it and let's go
Gangsta for life
'Til the day that I die
Yeah, I promise I'm standing high
'Cause you know that I'm down
We drivin' by with them headlights off
We know where you stay
Know what you did, we don't play that shit
Nigga we don't play, no
Everybody cried when you did your dirt
Acting like a bitch finna get you hurt
Breaking lives down to their knees, oh
Guns (Check), Girls (Check)
Come on, we ain't done yet
Got a lot to handle
We ain't takin' over the world yet
We're an army
Better yet, a navy
Better yet, crazy
Guns in the air
Can't hurt us again when you come around here
We got our guns, got our guns
We got our guns in the motherfuckin' air, oh
I'm down for life
Yeah, I promise I'll stand and fight
Gunfire left a hole in the tank, losing gasoline
Fire is on my trail and he's after me
Hope it don't get here before I get where I'm goin'
I gotta get where I'm goin'
Take off my mask to breathe
You could've been a part of a masterpiece
Fluid in the brakes was the last to leak
That's the thing
Where I'm goin', I don't need my brakes (Brakes)
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through
The lovers needa clear the road
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm comin' from
Fire bomb
Seems cold, but baby, no, it doesn't have to be
Microwaving our metal tragedy
Watching it burn and it's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful and it's through, it's the other half of me
I didn't do it, you lit the match for me
Now we're flying from the blast, baby
Where we're going, we don't need no brakes (Brakes)
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Baby, we were killin' 'em
They couldn't handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
As we were burning, the world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy
'Cause I believe the only move for me and you is to go out blazing
Oh, oh, oh
You say you love me
But they feel like words to me
Well, this just ain't working
Stop thinking you can run over me
Drifting, settling
Off to a foreign place
If I can't see what's in front of me
It's a mystery, well, then apparently
Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, be gone
Bye bye, so long
Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fa-a-ading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away
Put a sock in it, just stop running your mouth
Got my mind made up, I ain't coming back again
No way, no way, no way, no way
'Cause I'm so fed up, boy, you got me messed up
If we hooking back up, don't press your luck today, today
I'm blowing you away, yeah, yeah
Ta-ta, so long
Saw you turn into a ghost right in front of my eyes
Tell me, what's a girl to do when she's crying inside?
I'm about to go insane, I'm jumping off this train
Whether wrong or right, I'll be gone by night
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
I can pretend that I'm not lonely
But I'll be constantly fooling myself
I can pretend that it don't matter
But I'll be sitting here lying to myself
Some say love ain't worth the buck
But I'll give every dime I have left
To have what I've only been dreaming about
Everybody wants something, gotta want something
What are you living for?
Everybody needs something, fighting for something
I know what you're fighting for, 'cause we all...
We all want someone there to hold
We just want somebody
We all wanna be somebody's one and only
We all wanna be warm when it’s cold
No one wants to be left scared and lonely
We all want the same thing
Yeah, yeah, we all want love
I'm able to close my eyes, yet my heart's not so blind
I feel so entitled, love owes me, I want what's mine
And some say love ain't worth the buck
But I'll give my last dime
Here's a little story I've gotta tell
'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?
It shoulda been me and you
It coulda been you and me
But boy, you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
Now all I got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you
Now baby, it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby, I'm falling down
I need me a remedy
Been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
Baby, I'm hurting now
I know you're a better man
When I was your girl
This land is a better land
When you're in my world
Today will be better, babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have, that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you're my superstar
I'd give anything, baby here's my heart
My heart, my heart
My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it's over
Girl, I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grandmama's sofa
Girl, I got us lovey-dovey on my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein
You had your Guess jeans on, looking sexy, oh no
Girl, why could it not be the one?
[Bridge: Rihanna & 
will.i.am
Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
Is nothing without you
[Outro: Rihanna 
with will.i.am
All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got, 
is nothing without
All I've got, all I've got are these photographs
I don't know who you think I am
He been gone (gone) since 3:30 (3:30)
Been coming home lately at 3:30 (3:30)
I'm super cool, I've been a fool
But now I'm hot, and baby, you gon' get it
Now I ain't tripping, I ain't twisted
I ain't demented, well, just a lil' bit
I'm kickin' asses, I'm taking names
I'm on flame, don't come home, babe
I'm breakin' dishes up in here, all night (Uh-huh)
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights (Uh-huh)
I'ma fight a man tonight, I'ma fight a man tonight
I'ma fight a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, oh
I'm still waiting, come through the door
I'm killing time, you know, bleaching your clothes
I'm roasting marshmallows on the fire
And what I'm burning is your attire
I'm getting restless, I'm getting tested
And I can't believe he's always out every night and never checks in
Is he cheating? Man, I don't know
I'm looking 'round for something else to throw
I don't know who you think I am (I am, I am, I am, I am)
(I don't know who you think I am)
But I really don't give a damn right now
If you don't come, I'ma huff and puff and blow this, blow this, oh
Blow this, blow this, I'ma blow this, blow this, oh
Blow this house, house down
Dishes, breakin' dishes, breakin' dishes
A man, a man, a man
Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin'
(Dishes, dishes, dishes)
So give it to me like I want it
This is for your eyes only
Roc me out, back and forth
Roc me out, on the floor
Give it to me like I need it
You know how to make me feel it
Roc me out, more and more
Come over boy, I'm so ready
You're taking too long to get my head on the ground
And my feet in the clouds, oh oh
I'm so clean, feeling so dirty
Come right now, you better hurry
Before you miss out, and I finish it off
Oh, yeah
I've been a bad girl, daddy
Won't you come get me?
Keep it up for me, you can do it
Put your hands on me, watch me lose it
Boy, blew it out, like it's the only way out
I'll show you my dirty secrets
We'll hush up boy, don't just speak it
Whatever we do, it's between me and you
It's gonna different tonight
The best time in your life
I just want you to know, baby
Take a peek at the girl I hide
I'll let you in on a dirty secret
I just wanna be loved
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can I not like you for awhile?
You upset me girl
All of a sudden I forget
For too long that's wrong
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
And I hate how much I love you boy (yeah)
And I hate how much I love you boy (oh whoa)
And I hate that I love you so (oh)
You completely know the power that you have (power that you have)
The only one makes me laugh (one makes me laugh)
That I...
Love you beyond the reason why
And it just ain't right
And I hate how much I love you girl (oooh)
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah)
And I hate how much I love you girl (yeah)
But I just can't let you go (oooh)
One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me (hmm)
As much as I need you
And I hate how much I love you boy
(But I just can't let you go no)
And I hate that I love you so (Ohhh)
And I hate that I love you so so
What's up?
I know we haven't spoken for a while
But I was thinkin' 'bout you
And it kinda made me smile
So many things to say
And I'll put 'em in a letter
Thought it might be easier
The words might come out better
How's your mother? hHw's your little brother?
Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line to the story of me and you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better, as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you
Still not over you
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that remain since you've been gone
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me
Like a silly joke, or something on the TV
Boy, it ain't easy
When I hear our song, I get that same old feeling
Wish I could press rewind, turn back the hands of time
And I shouldn't be telling you
Did you know I kept all of your pictures?
Don't have the strength to part with them yet, oh no
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste
But some things a girl can never forget
Oh, I tried to forget you
Take off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my skirt
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece
Sorrow decreased, pressure released
I put in work, did more than called upon
More than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)
But it taught me
Before a decision, ask this question first
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Take off my cool (Take off my cool)
Show them that under here, I'm just like you
Do the mistakes I've made make me a fool?
Or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, round of applause (Round of applause)
Take the abuse
Sometimes, it feels like they want me to lose (Want me to lose)
It's entertainment; is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers whether win or lose, is
Dear Diary, it's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living
This is not who I am
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal
I laugh (Haha), I get mad, I hurt
I think guys suck sometimes
But when you're in the spotlight, everything seems good
Ooh, yeah
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst
'Cause I have to always keep my guard up
I don't know who to trust
I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am
I guess they know I'm bad, bad
I got a problem
I need you to solve it
Shopaholic's what they call 'em
My addiction, my prescription
Gimme shoes and give me bags
How much you want? I need 'em bad
All them girls be checking my bags
While they be biting my swag
I guess they know I'm bad, bad (bad)
What a bad little girl I am (I got a problem) (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am (I need you to solve it) (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am
Bad bad bad bad bad bad
Don't need no bargain, need no sale
I want the best, I dress me well
Love Cavalli dipped in Versace
Chic ain't cheap and everybody knows
While they be bitin' my swag (yeah)
I guess they know I'm bad, bad (bad, bad, bad)
She a bad girl, a real shopaholic
She buying everything up, man, I can't call it
And she a walking store, I'm talking 'bout her clothes
I just pause, I'm in awe, 'cause she a fashion show
Real Louis bags and breathe Gucci
Got a wardrobe like she's staring in a movie
And she ain't even famous but she got her own groupies
She got her own groupies
Said she got her own groupies (bad)
One spliff a day keep my mind right
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One-one spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil-evil away
I blow tree everyday in my house, in my car, I love to blaze
Got the best smoke on the west coast, in LA (that's right)
Smoking bomb-bomb going dum-dum
Screaming one love got my L up, bout to roll a blunt
Take a puff-puff of the diesel
Hit the plug up till I run us a kilo
I'm laid back in a Maybach blowing zeroes
Up to the ozone gripping my solo I'm so gone so long
I might just bring a gram to the Grammy's
I might cop it straight off the boat in Miami
If you ain't puttin' my nigga then we ain't passin'
Light up my troubles then watch them turn into ashes
One-one spliff a day keep da evil away
You know I smoke so I can blow the pain away
And as you know
Wake up in the morning then I pray to Jah
Please give me mercy fi the ganja
Know they gotta' smell this dime bag on this dimepiece
I might catch a charge if the copper search me
Not one, not two, not three, not four
Who the fuck these narcos at my door
They want war, they want war
I make green my decor
Imma let these motherfuckers know who da boss
Here we are
Midair off of the cliff
Staring down at the end again
But then again, maybe we're finally
On the road that's headed away from all your complaining
Of hearing the same song
But baby, we'll hear it when I'm gone
It's time to turn on the last song
Oooh
The last song
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared?
And the sad song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
It was ours
But I'd do it again, holding hands with my friend again
But then again, maybe we gave our all
A song we'll never forget
Baby let 'em play it, maybe it'll save the world
They gon' miss hearing it when it's gone
But it's time to turn on the last song
What if we left every moment that we could spare?
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
You'll never know when the songs gonna play
The last song you'll hear is the one you made
Your song was beautiful
That's why I started singing it
But this song is our song, so it's playing until the end
Even if it's the last song
Sell me candy like it’s summer when it’s melting in my hands
I know you’re around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling, whisper something in my ear
You're sweet like sugar, tell me what I wanna hear
I’m weak by your touch and when it’s melting on my lips
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips
You’re selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy) You the boss
You could be a professional, boy, you make a sale
I try to resist, but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
The running through my body, now you’re knocking at my door
A thin little kiss and your call is really sweet
But the shawty that you’re rocking is nothing like me
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core (You know)
I wanna play, more than you know
So don’t you leave, and don’t you go
I want it all, until time falls
His arms, I want to roam
I wanna love, give him my trust
I wanna live, for both of us
I wanna breathe you, lay on your shoulder
I wanna warm you when nights get colder
I want love, love, love
We break, break
We're breaking down
It's getting later baby, and I'm getting curious
Nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious
'Cause the beat penetrates my body
Shaking inside my bones
And you're pushing all my buttons
Taking me out of my zone, yeah
The way that you stare, starts the fire in me
Come up to my room, you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me
Push up on me
I know many guys just like you, extremely confident
Got so much flavor with you, like you're the perfect man
You wanna make me chase you, like it's a compliment
But let's get right down to it
I can be the girl that'll break you down
I wanna see how you move it
Show me, show me how you do it
You really got me on it, I must confess (I must confess)
Baby, there ain't nothing to it
Baby, who you think you're fooling?
You wanna come and get me outta my dress, oh
The way that you stare, starts the fire in me (The way you stare at me)
Come up to my room, you sexy little thing (Sexy little thing)
And let's play a game (Yeah), I won't be a tease (No, baby)
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing (Oh-oh-oh)
I wish you would push up on me (I wish you would)
I wish you would light me up (Light me up)
And say you want me
Push up on me (And say you want me)
I wish you would push up on me (Oh-oh)
Push up on me (Light me up)
I got a house, but I need new furniture
Why spend mine when I could spend yours?
The truth is I will love you the same
But why complain? You buying Gucci, babe
You might see me in the spot
Ya boy think I'm hot
So I came up in here to get what you got
I'm hot like the block
Uh-huh, you like that
Know you wanna bite that
Uh-huh, yeah, right there
They love the young girl
They wanna give it to me
Wish I was in a flick
And I ain't talking movies
If ya young, if ya hot, girl
Shake what ya got, girl
I keep 'em singing
[Chorus: Rihanna & 
The-Dream
Lemme get that (Huh?)
What you got up in them jeans?
Put it on me, or get lonely
You know, five car garages
Name on your bank account, all day massages
I wanna put it on blast
Better slow down, for I make you crash, boy
Got what you want
Baby, got what you need
But we can't proceed
Unless you got that for me
I'ma put you on the spot
Keep the sheet in knots
I bought me a Benz
You buy me the yacht
A girl need a lot
The girl need some stocks
Bonds is what I got, bonds is what I got (Ya get it?)
I keep 'em singing...
Baby got what you need
Ohh
Boy, I know you want my love, love
Nothing is free in this world, world
Unless my love is your love, your love
I'm not a gold digger
Some girls play the game
They all walk and talk and they dress the same
Nothing new to say
Don't they realize
That it's so easy to see right through their disguise?
Makes me wonder why
When the whole world's turning left
It's when I'm going right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside
'Cause a girl like me is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything if I asked him to?
To take all my dreams and to make them true
Show me all the reasons that you oughta be, with a girl like me
Just like me
Possibility
Got me trippin', thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me
Still, I need to know
Should I keep this feeling or let it go?
I can't wait no more
So now's the time to speak your mind
And show me what you feel
So tell me if you wanna take a chance on something real
Never gonna settle for second best (Never gonna settle)
That would give me anything if I asked him to? (If I asked him to)
Mirror Mirror, on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the answer here tonight
Catch me now before I fall (Before I fall)
I need someone to let me be just who I am inside
And a girl like me
Could it be a boy like you? (Could it be a boy like you?)
That would give me anything if I asked him to (If I asked him to)
Ohh, just like me

(Instantaneous)
I can do a lot of shit but I can't make you love yourself
But the way you make love
It feels like you ain't thinking 'bout nothing else but us
But you're holding back
Always so strong and don't complain
Holding back
I've been waiting for this all day
Don't be afraid
To feel it
One more time, just feel it
Fucking cry
How you gonna fucking hide from me?
Where you gonna fucking hide?
Just feel it, feels nice
You should tell me what's bugging you
And I'ma tell ya 'bout me
Make a wish and tell me your deepest thoughts
And I'ma make it easy
Make a wish and tell me what's bugging you
Emotions running wild
I could feel it when I'm next to you
Something's on ya mind
You wanna stay, but won't tell me
It's about ya secrecy
So what are you tryna hide?
I know what the look means
You hold my hand so tightly
Whenever we say goodbye
Standing by the door
I could tell you can't take no more
Blow your secret open wide
So maybe if you say it (Say it)
Tell me what it is you like (Like)
Baby, baby, don't be shy (Shy)
Maybe you can spend the night (Night)
If you say it
But if you playing (Not with it)
'Cause you know what I wanna hear (Hear)
Say it, that'll make it more clear (Clear)
I need to know how you feel
So baby, why won't you (Say it)
Say it (Say it)
Won't, won't you tell me
What, what's goin' on?
Why, why you waitin' on it?
What you waiting for?
Soon you should tell me or I might be gone
But I'm here for you, baby
You should put me on
I won't shoot you down
Make you feel some kinda way
If you'll be honest with me
Put away your pride
I can see it in your face
You want me permanently (Uh)
Like how I whine when we dancing
I know how it happened
And I'm right there with you
But I won't be the first to put myself out there
The feeling is mutual
But I bet if you (Say it)
Your eyes steady talking
And you're tryna fight it
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven
If we go look together
So won't, won't you tell me
And get it off your chest
So baby why won't you (Say it)
Ladies and Gentleman
To those among you who are easily frightened
We suggest you turn away now
To those of you who think you can take it
We say welcome to the mad house

Yes to this yes, yes to that yes, to whateva you suggest
So please say yes
Haters gonna hate (Let them hate)
I found out much too late
I think I know we're a little hot now (Feel mature with my pride)
The truth leads to the lies
The heart ain't always right (I know that)
And I see that love is blind now (I can show you)
Boy, you used to have my trust
Without trust, there ain't no us, boy
You don't love me (You don't love me) and I know now
(Love you forever with all my heart)

You don't love me (You don't love me)
And I know (And I know) now
Take away your things and go
Can't take back what you said, oh no
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe
I'm on my knees right now
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh that same old love
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
So I won't be changing too, you know
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees right now, oh
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love (hey!)
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I never should've waited so long to say
What I've always known since the very first day
Thought that you would stay forever with me
But the time has come to leave
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye
Hold, draw me close, close to my lips
Listen intently as I tell you this
Outside the world wages its wars
I'll rest in peace as long as you know
Promise you our love will carry on
Until you turn eternal, we belong
His respectful lips for the last time
And spell out the lyrics to love in the sky
So I'll lay here with you
'Til the final goodbye
Goodbye
Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone
Only see him after dark
I met him on the six train
Just the way he said my name
The brother had a lotta game
Had me open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride
Friday about a quarter to nine
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine
There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything
I know his crew's kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady
Gives me everything I need
I don't care who's hating on me
'Cause every night, he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down
But every time that he's around
My heart's on lock down
I feel love and I'm so proud
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me (So good to me)
I'm gonna give him everything (Give him everything)
T-H-U-G in ya life, baby
One in a million, that's what you are to me
And I know your friends say I'm rough
But I still got the tender touch just to make you giggle and blush
But ya mom does not approve of us
She needs to be a lot more understanding
'Cause all I have for you is thug loving
And loving, that's all I'm giving
Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me (He's all I ever need)
We'll be together from now 'til forever
I know it's the real thing
If you don't, whatever
And I know it's meant to be
I know it's meant to be
How am I gonna tell my mama? (How am I gonna tell my mama?)
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me (Yeah)
I'm gonna give him everything (Give him all of me)
Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry (All of me)
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-oh-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
It's been a minute since I saw you, boy
Must admit, it's good to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when you're around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelings deep inside
It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again
I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize, I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Here I go again
Still remember how you make me weak
How I fought to find the words to speak
I just can't escape the memories
I tried, but I just can't break free
Thought I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep coming back
Didn't think that you could make me lose control like that
Everytime I hear your name
Sweet lovin' is my ting
So you know mi got fi swing
That's why yuh request it again
Without a doubt yuh want to spend
And to experience it again
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
So make me light it up again
Reignite the flames again
'Cause I really miss 'dem days when we used to chill
Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Negril
Girl yuh Bajan beauty it a gimme di chill
Not to mention the way you are within'
And I realize I've never gotten over you
Boy, I'm still in love with you, no matter what you do
We belong together forever
Here we lay, face to face once again
Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
We're just holding onto "could have been's" that we should be letting go
It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can't hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
Was it me, or was it you that broke away?
What we were is like a season, love is change
And every time I think about it
It tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion
But I got no more tears to cry
Away
We can try to talk it over
But we've walked that road before
While our song is playing its last note
And we both know for sure
That it's time to close that door
A million miles away
Ooh yeah
When you stand so close to me
I'm feeling butterflies
Is this the way that it supposed to be when I look into your eyes?
All you have to do is say my name
Just a stutter, more like butter
Since I met you, boy, my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this
Boy, you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking maybe you're the one
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy little thing called love)
(Whoa, yeah!)
My best friends tell me "Rihanna, what's got into you?"
I said "
LeAndra
, I can't explain these feelings I'm going through"
They tell me "Girl, it's not like you to fall this way"
I try my best to wear a disguise, but it's written on my face
Got me thinking maybe you're the one (maybe you're the one)
(A crazy crazy little thing called love)
Girl, it's crazy It's amazing
It's the loving that you feeling
Put a tingle in your body every time you want a healing
Hey Rihanna
Baby girl, for you missing the song, yeah
So tell the DJ put the pon de replay
If you wanna
Come on my bajun, baby
Let me take to Jamaica
And introduce you to the real thing
For the loving where you are
So baby you're my number 1, not number 2
So if its lovin' that you want
Baby, you should make me your boo
Boy, you got me catching feelings (Boy, you got me)
Got me thinking maybe you're the one (Maybe you're the one)
That my heart was beating like a drum (Beating like a drum)
A crazy little thing called love (Crazy, crazy, baby, baby)
Don't understand the meaning
This means crazy, baby
I try my best not to show
But you know it's so crazy, baby
Crazy little thing called love
I'm not concerned with people
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man (Oh, yeah)
'Cause they only wanna know you, enroll you
Only for the things ya had
I just think it's so sad
Get dem haters out your circle (Haters)
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring ya down
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down
They keep evil thoughts in their hearts (What you don't know)
You can't let them knock your hustle
Not letting them know how much you struggle
They turn green with envy when you're on top
And dem heart is full with strife
They're gonna try to take your life
Get dem haters out your circle
Ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
Don't be fooled, you better recognize
They're not there for you
They don't care for you
Trust me cause I know it's true
Ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down
Then they turn against you when you're not around
It's just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity
Trust me cause I know its true
I want your sexuality
I see you
What you wanna do
Let's break the rules (sexuality)
You wanna go down
Drive all through my town
Till I make that sound (ohhh)
Sexuality
Now don't be shy
You know I'm what you like
Please don't hide your sexuality
Baby let's go
Loose all self control
If you wanna know my sexuality
You want me
Then make a move
Come show me just what you can do (ohhh)
I'm ready
You're ready too
So come with me tonight boo
Boy show me
What's your fantasy
Let me see your sexuality
Your body
You want on top of me
Then just release your
When I'm hot
Giving a right spot
Do unlock
My sexuality
You went
I ride
You know
I'll get mine
Boy you gonna like my
Come show me just what you can do
I want your
Uuuh
What's your fantasy (I wanna see)
Let me see your sexuality (sexuality)
Sexuality (Yeah)
Let me see your sexuality (let me see)
Wanna see you baby (sexuality)
I rest my hand across your lips
Feel your breath by my fingertips
No longer can I alay what is right
But this love, it won't give up without a fight
I'd write a note and tear it up
There are no words that could say enough
I know I'm gonna hurt you when l walk out that door
But I swear it's gonna hurt me even more
You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye
Wish I could see the dreams tonight
Wish I could make them turn out right
Tempted to turn back for just one last kiss
But my heart tells me it's better just like this
So this is how the story ends
When love is gone, you can't pretend
No matter who else I give my heart to
There's a part of it that still belongs to you
You made me strong when I was weak
Gave my heart a voice to speak
You must've known this day would come
When the lessons are all done
All except for one, no
Lyrics available upon release. Stay tuned!
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't lie
Emotions come and go
Who knows how the wind will blow?
There's so little in this world to trust in
Seduce themselves with lies
Some don't realize
They call it love, but it's really only lusting
So you see you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between 'yes' and 'no'
'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I've been missin'
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen
And it's tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in something I don't trust in?
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause baby, kisses don't lie
Telling you, it's the truth, don't you ask why
You whispered in my ear
But are your words sincere?
'Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
You see, I'm nobody's fool
I play by my own rules
So please think twice before you step into my life
Kissses don't lie
Boy, let me, let me
Why don't you let me, let me?
Let me do those things for you
I've been watching you from way 'cross the room
Won't ya come and rock it out with me?
You catchin' eyes like you catchin' ties
Over here's where you wanna be
It's so familiar, like we've met somewhere before
And I'm tired of waitin', baby, while you still obey me
Want me, come and whisper in your ear
All the things you love to hear
I wanna come play nice with you
'Cause if I get you alone, I don't know what I might do
And I think that it's about time we leave
'Cause boy, you're my type
You got me so excited
Baby, let's go dance away
So let me come and get ya right
Boy, let me fill your appetite
Won't you let me know what it is you like?
And I'll do those sexy things for you
I'll let you call me beautiful
Let me give it to you once, you 'gon want some more
Boy, let me, let me, let me
I'm walkin' over to you, meet me by the door
I'm the girl in the seven inch heels
I got my keys in my hand
Maybe S's on my arms, so guess you know what it is
So act like you know
'Cause a girl just wanna have fun
Knock it out the park for me
Need ya to hit a home run, boy
Let too much to talk about it
Not into me, boy, I doubt it
You are gonna scream and shout it
Make you hot how I move my body
So crazy, so amazing
Catch you up and make you chase it
Let me, let me, baby
Boy let me, let me
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
Used to love you, used to love you
Every night, every day
Oh, I be thinking (yeah) 'bout the way you touch me
'Bout the way you kiss me, when I'm sleeping, yeah
By the way, what's his name? (What's his name?)
I heard you creeping (creeping, oh, hey, yeah)
Baby, babe
I belong with you, you belong with me
What were you thinking?
Girl, I don't know what you was thinking, babe (oh, oh)
Used to love you, used to love you (baby, oh)

Late in a midnight hour

Used to make my toes curl, yeah
Girl, you used to rock my world, ah
Make me feel so good, yeah, hey
Now to sing her latest recording
It's the beautiful, Miss Rihanna
Now this be the last time you did me wrong
No more layin' up in your arms
No calling, sayin' you want me back
I'm packin' my bags, what you think about that?
Stayed at home like a good girl do
But tonight, baby, you got me sad and blue
I just heard about the girl in your car, y'all kissin' at the bar
Got me cryin'
Oh, you got me hatin' on the club
'Cause you took my love
Oh, you took my love
Now you got me like whoa
You got me hatin' on the club
Why'd you have to take my love? Whoa
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...
And you can be mad at me all you want
I ain't comin' in, I'll be waitin' out front
Comin' out the door with your girlfriend
You did me wrong, boy, tell me where our love went
Now this is the sound of a broken heart
There's only one reason why we're apart
She never woulda made it to your car
If it wasn't for the club, I'd still have my love
I'd still have my love
We would still have us
But now we're, now we're like whoa
Ohhh, you got me hatin' on the club
But now, now we're like whoa
You took my love
You got her hatin', oh, you got her hatin' on the—
Club, club, club, club
Here we go
(Oh) la, la, la, la, la, yeah

(Oh) la, la, la, la, la (Oh-oh-oh-oh) sing it
(Oh) la, la, la, la, la, come on
Oh la, oh la, oh la, oh la, oh
You said we girls, but all the while
You look at my man with a funny smile
Now I don't know, it might be me
But ain't no need to bump so tightly
That night we all hangin' at the club
You tell Mr. DJ wanna rub a dub
When I don't look
You took a chance to ask my man to come and dance
What me and he got
Solid as a rock, so take your shot
Don't even waste your time
'Cause a love like ours is hard to find (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh) 'Cause he's got me singing that la la la
(Oh) Our love is strong, yes, it's keeping me fortified
(Oh) Oh yes, he keep it rocking like la la la
(Sing) (Oh, oh, oh, oh) Ladies get it right, better get it right
(Oh) He got me singing that la la la
(Oh) So fall back, don't be hit and you can't deny
I hope you take this as a lesson learned
This ain't that kind of party, so just let it burn
The next time you see me act like you know
I don't play those games, don't take me for a joke
'Cause a love like ours is hard to find
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh) Oh yes he keep it rocking like la la la
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, Rihanna
Oh, whoa, here we go
We got, we got, what him and me, we got, we got

(Oh) He's got me singing that la la la
(Oh) Our love is strong yes it's keeping me fortified
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
Listen, closely
Hear the music playin'
Let it take you to places far away and relax your senses
Just do what you wanna do
No need for questions
It's only for you
And it's so amazing, oh, how you can't escape it
The movement takes you and never let's you go
Can't you feel the music in the air?
Close your eyes, let the rhythm take you there
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Forget about your troubles, it's alright
Let 'em go 'til we see the morning light
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun (
The sun
Come and dance to the music of the sun, the sun (
The sun, yeah
So real, so right
Can't explain the feeling
Like the sunlight brings to life new meaning
No need for stress (
No need for stress
Save that for another day
No second guessing
Just trust me when I say
Close your eyes, let the rhythm take you there (
Let the rhythm take you there
Music of the sun
Let them go 'til we see the morning light (
See the morning light
Of the sun, oh, yeah
Forget about your troubles, it's alright (
It's alright, it's alright
Let it take you far
It'll take you far away, far away
Baby boy, what you done to me?
I saw you smiling suddenly
I can't get you out my mind
I got it bad boy, I can't lie
I want your time and your full attention
I wanna to talk to you
And not to mention good love that you give to me
I think about it constantly
No, I won't apologize for feeling like I do
It's just the simple facts of life
I'm crazy over you
I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day
I'm addicted to what you're giving me, boy
It's killing me
When it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl
I understand that you got your crew
But I've got something in mind for you
Make you lose all track of time
Guaranteed to blow your mind
I don't care what anybody got to say
Maybe they never had it quite this way
Let them talk and criticize
They all need to recognize
They might see I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
What I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way
I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you (I'm a selfish girl)
(When it comes to love, I don't share)
Boy, you got me tripping
I didn't know what I was missing
This is crazy (Crazy)
So amazing (So amazing)
I didn't mean to be demanding, but I hope you're understanding
I'm not playing, boy (I'm not playing, boy)
I'm just saying, boy
They might seem I'm a bit extreme
But what I feel can't be concealed
(I'm a selfish girl) I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day (Every day)
(Need you in my world, I'm a selfish girl)
I didn't know what I was missing (Didn't know what I was missing)
I didn't mean to be demanding, but I hope your understanding
Once was a time you and I
Made a promise till the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that I'd get burned
Silly me, I believed in your fairy tales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, now this song is through
The things you said, I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But I'm still standing tall as I walk away
And you know that it's true when you hear me say
It's over, it's through
Ain't a thing you can do, boy
It's sad, but it's true
Or ever will deceive these eyes (Ever will deceive these eyes)
No, I'm never gonna hear your lies (Hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear (Make it clear)
Incase you didn't hear
No, baby
Oh, silly me, I believed in your fairytales
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips (Ever gonna kiss these lips)
Baby boy, it's the last time (It's the last time)
I'm never gonna hear your lies (Never gonna hear your lies)
Ain't a thing you can do but wonder why
Baby, goodbye
Cause I'm never gonna, never gonna cry no more
Why do you call when I'm not feelin' you? (baby)
Why can't you leave? Boy, just walk away
When are you going to understand ohhha..
What sort of things they be tellin' you
I've got to stop them from compelling you boy
They better stop, they're not helping you ohhha...
Don't even try, 'cause I know
That, you're not the one
Don't waste your time
Goodbye, don'tcha cry
The game is done
I'm gonna tell you right here
Let this be the last time
I'm gonna make it so clear
Boy, you must be outcha mind
You must be outcha mind
Don't you lie, don't you try
Say goodbye, it just won't work
Your head's in the sky, must be trippin'
Must be high, but there's so much I'm worth
I'm not stupid, I'm not a fool
I know what I'm doin', I went to school
You better listen, do what you're told
My love's more valuable than a pot of gold
Must be outcha your mind
Don't even try, 'cause I, know that you're not the one
Goodbye, don't you cry
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
It's like spendin' time with you
Just doin' absolutely nothing
That makes me happy
When you're at work, puttin' on your t-shirt
And I love it, absolutely love it
It's the smile of a child
It's your eyes, it's your hair
It's the touch of your skin
That's what gets me there
It's also enticing
Waking up from a nice dream
To a beautiful morning with you by my side
That's nice
It's like walkin' through the sprinklers
Smellin' every flower one by one
Mmm, yeah, makes me happy, yeah
It's like telling me you love me
Showin' me you love me, baby, my pretty baby
It's like Saturday, ohh
Four day weekend, ohh
Hiding and seeking with you
Like we do, it's beautiful
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
You know you thrill me
Seconds of everyday
Biting on my body
Feel like another day
It must be magic
To make them disappear
Erase the past
You made the future clear
I like how you thrill me (thrill me)
You made me love you (love you)
Your just like a pill to me
You love to drug me (drug me)
Calls are lovely (lovely)
Don't know what you do to me
But I know how much I
Like it, like it
How much I
Like it, like it, I like it
Like it (like it) like it (like it)
I Like it (like it) like it (like it)
Your like the clouds
Breaking out all the dawn
Cleared out the path
All I can see was sun
Running through me
Feels like this is destiny (yea)
I'm suffocating
When you too far from me
I don't want to need u
But to please me completely
And I never wanted anything this way
Your just like a love that can't escape
Stare at the lights get lost in time
My reflections in the mirror I don't know (I don't know)
U make me lose on something (lose composure when u go)
It's your hallucination that make me wanna go
Must be your function got me bouncing off the walls
My reflections in the mirror I don't know (baby I don't know)
It's your hallucination that make me wanna go (baby, you got me)
Took a chance
Rolled the dice on me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you write a story much too fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn’t last
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Remember when we said our love would last forever?
But then again, how are we to know?
There comes a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there'll always be a first time you get burned
Oh, whoa
I don't regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart’s the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby, can't you see?
It’s the way it’s gotta be
Yeah, no no
Ah, ah, a-ah
Footsteps on the stairs aren't really there
Feel like there's someone watching me
Shadows on the wall, whispers down the hall
When I look, there's nothing to see
You say that you let her go
Turned the page and closed the door
I can't get inside your head
'Cause when I try, she's there instead
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh
You say that she's gone, that you moved on
So why do I feel her eyes on me?
Invisible chains keep us in pain
Won't you please tell her set you free?
Sometimes when you look past me
Your eyes see someone I can't see
So I'm giving up this war
'Cause I can't fight it anymore
Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave (Oh, no)
The walls are closing in, it's so damn hard to breathe
(There ain't nothing I could do about it) No, no
Haunted (Haunted), haunted, ooh
I don't wanna fight anymore
Someone's walkin' out that door
Hold up, lemme get this straight
Saying you’d be there to do whatever it takes
To make more brand new days of my life
My troubles would be over if I made you my wife
Right, right
I ain't saying I died
Lemme take a second and I think about it
What about it?
I couldn't deal with this chick
So I wouldn’t mind being here to here on the script
Then come and take a walk with me, walk with me
I could understand why you want me
My mom told me one day I could make a lady lucky
We came home together
You know how chick do try and make a head miss when you hit that thing true miss
Little lady, you was right from the ghetto
I don’t know if I wanna handcuff you yet miss
Missta guns and that
I need a friend ma join me or wanna have sex
I wanna let you know that you don't have to go
Don't wonder no more what I think about you
Baby, slow down
Just hear me out
There's something I gotta let you know
No need to push
No need to rush
You know you had me from 'hello'
When it comes to my heart, I don't play
Baby boy, can't you see the stop sign?
You're moving much too fast
Baby, love doesn't grow in a day
Just get it right the first time
Make this feeling last
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (Take our time)
Don't you know that it's getting late?
And I know what's on your mind
I know this feeling is crazy
It's mutual baby
But we don't have to rush something real
Boy, can't you see?
I'm not tryna be the girl who gets taken for a ride
You take your time, and you will find there's so much more to me inside
And you say there's no need to delay
You're telling me to trust you
Boy, you know I want to, baby
But my heart, it's so recently break
Before we take this very far, show me who you really are
And I know what's on your mind (I know, baby, baby, yeah, yeah)
I know this feeling is crazy (Crazy)
It's mutual, baby (Mutual, baby)
And make this feeling last
Don't you know that it's getting late? (It's getting late)
And I know what's on your mind (And I know just what's on your mind, your mind, your mind, mind)
It's mutual, baby
We don't have to rush it
Our time
Start time, no

Amazing that stays with me all night and day
Makes my temperature rise
Boy, your love has got me so hypnotized
I'm feeling something that I can't understand
It's like I'm captured by the touch of your hand
It's so vibe, it's your style, it's the way hat you smile
Get a little rush when I hear your name
It's all magnetic with your hand next to me
Holdin' me close happens so naturally
We connect, this electrical feeling inside
Didn't know that even if I tried
You got me spinning like a merry go round
Feels like I'm flyin', but I ain't off the ground
Fallin' fast, I'm afraid, can't escape, there's no way
Never had a feeling like this before
It's amazing how you drive me crazy
Boy keep doin' what you're doin'
Cause you're really gettin through to me
Day and night babe, you know I can't fight it
Just one look into my eyes and you know you got me hypnotized

Bubble pop, bubble pop, bubble pop, bubble pop, bubble pop
You might think it's strange or deranged how I make it bounce
Sugar sweet just like a candy cane melting in your mouth
Cotton covered lemon drops make it hard I'll make it pop
Once I'll show you how you'll never get enough
I pop my bubble, hey, I pop my bubble, hey hey
I pop my bubble, yeah, I make my bubble pop
For you I'll make it pop
For you for you
I'll make it pop
Boy don't be afraid of the way that I captivate
Sticky if you touch it, might get lost and you can't escape
Cherry flavored, yummy yum, boy be nice I'll give you some
Of my tasty cake I know you love so much
Come get lost with me
I dare you to try-ey-yy-ey-yy-ey-yy
 (x80)
Bubble pop
I just met infatuation
It's something in his smile
But my obsession can't stand the thoughts of you and I
Something takes over, pulls me up onto my feet
Before I know it I got you pushing up on me
On the floor
Under the burning lights
I'm screaming look behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me
Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin' it like I'm at work
I'm making that thang jump
I'm making that thang twerk (so get up on it baby)
I'm doin what I do
I make it move
Got me out here whipping my hair awww
Baby, I just might have what you need
Sprinkling you with pieces of me
Now lets make it a sight to see, baby
Out her whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin it like I'm at work
Got me whipping my hair, awww
We flashing pictures
Kodak moment memory
Look at the flickers
Sparks on my camera screen
The buried treasure
Come with me and we will find
Create a perfect world just for you and I
Burning lights
Screaming look behind
I'm making that thang twirk
So get up on it baby
All them girls in the club
Get down tonight
All them girls grab a boy
Doin it right
Boy, your standin' real close to me
Tell me now, what's it gonna be?
You like what you see but lovin' don't come easily
Now your whisperin' in my ear, all the things that I wanna hear
Let me make it very clear, words are not enough for me
Did you think that you could smile and steal my heart away?
Can't deny I like your style, but it just don't work that way
Ooh, I'm kinda feelin' you right now
You keep me standin' tight now
It's gettin hard to fight now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I?
Ooh, you know they're playin' my song now
You know you're turnin' me on now
The feelings gettin' strong now
Back and forth, baby, round and round
So high that I can't come down
It's too late to turn back now
Still, I'm scared to lose control
Feel the heat burning like the sun
Feel the beat as we move as one
Don't stop til' the night is done
Hold me close, boy, don't let go
Still, I got to know if this is real or just a dream
Because in the mornin', my true love is what I wanna see
Ooh, I'm kinda feelin' you right now (Feelin' you baby)
It's gettin' hard to fight now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I? (Still, I wonder, wonder should I?)
You know you're turnin' me on now (Ooh, baby)

Let me stop put it pon her 'cause she a get it real deep
Did you think you could smile and steal my heart away?
Ooh, I'm kinda feelin' you right now (Feelin' you right now)
Ooh, I'm kinda feelin' you right now (Can't control what I'm feeling baby)
New on the streets
My name's Rihanna
I'm a soldier true and through
I know I'll make it through the storm
I really want you to realize
I really want you to put me on
I've been searchin' for somebody
To let me be all I can be
Music is my inspiration
It's the only thing I need
So I try my best and pray to God
My dreams will all turn real
'Cause there's a fire burnin' in my heart
I hope you all can feel
To my music I'll be faithful
You know I'll give my all and all
Through the good times and the bad times
Summer, winter, spring and fall
My name is Rihanna
Let go!
You got a hole in my head
You got a hole in my head girl
No use, your lips keep moving
But I got a couple of screws loose
Them other boys talkin' about me
They say I'm bad news
And probably best for you to keep this short
It's my time to interrupt
Gonna take a lot to start me up
I don't think you wanna deal right now
And not with me (With me)
Don't start with me (With me)
I got a, got a, got a gun on me
I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
'Cause I was feelin' watered down
You're gonna drown
All over your radio, see me in the stadium
I'll spin your body
Imma run to let these ladies know
Watch your tone around me
Don't push my buttons
You don't really wanna see me get wild
G-G-get wild
I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
Buckle up, I ride this like a fast car
Suck it up, don't even try to act hard
And you can try to run but you won't get very far
And you can try to hide but I know where you are
Let loose, I see right through you
You got a hole in your head too
And I knew it the very moment I met you
So I hope you got your swagger up
You know just what I love
Gonna take a lot to work me up
I don't think you wanna do it right now
I got a, got a, got a attitude on me
And I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
Baby might drown
Catch me on your mind baby
Don't waste my time baby
Now watch me wine
You can take that as a sign baby
So left and right with me
Now push my buttons
You see me go wild
Go, go wild
I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)
(Oh, oh)
Sometimes I go crazy
Watch me, watch me
[Bridge: Justin Timberlake & 
(Uh, uh, break it down) 
I hear voices in my head, they go "Oooh"
I hear voices in my head, they go "Oooh" (
Uh, now go "Oooh"
Now go...
[Outro: Justine Timberlake & 
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head girl (
Rihanna, Rupee uh
Warning, warning, the hurricanes coming (come on)
So all your haters out there, yes you better start running (start running now)
Lock your doors, protect your homes (yeah)
The hurricanes coming through the microphone (ah)
Blowing up right through your zone (uh)
Coming straight toward your throne (coming straight for your throne, ah)
Hurricane, it's the hurricane (hurricane, it's the hurricane)
Blowing holes right through your brain (blowing holes right straight through your brain)
Hurricane, it's the hurricane
Hurricane (kill it Rihanna, yo)
Straight out the Carribean Sea
You know you gotta feel me
I'm a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 category, and I'm so deadly
Come from the land of Barbados
And you know that I'm more dangerous
I'm coming for the come gonna huff and a puff
And blow your house down
You've got to dig this one (one)
Tell them all to run (run)
When it's said and done (done)
I'll be a champion (heh)
Moving strong and fast (ah)
The industry's forecast (what)
Just put me first and the rest of them last (and the rest of them last)
And the rest of them last (come on girl, yeah)
Hurricane, it's the hurricane (hurricane, hurricane, hah)
Blowing holes right through your brain (straight through your brain, hah)
Hurricane  (hurricane, hurricane, hurricane)
So you better be warned
Don't be fooled by the eye of the storm
'Cause when you least expect
Imma creep right in
You best protect your neck
So whoever you are
No matter near or far
Just check your radar
And look out for Rihanna
You've got to dig this one
Tell them all to run
When it's said and done
I'l be the champion
Say what?
Warning, warning (this is a warning)
Warning, warning (Rupee, Rihanna, yeah)
Coming straight out of Barbados
Whoa, yeah
Baby, please, you don’t have to explain the reasons
This is me, I know your mind can change like the seasons
Go your way, I know the world is calling your name, boy
It’s okay, 'cause what we got, it ain’t gonna change, boy
As long as we’ve been together
You’ve always been the one
Nobody knows you better
When all is said and done
When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?
You and me, we go back to jump rope in grade school
Memories when you were trying too hard to play cool
I don't mind, I know that you've gotta go to your changes
Take your time, sometimes the heart rearranges
(Can't find your way back home)
And you know that you're all alone (You're all alone)
Who ya gonna run to? (Who ya gonna run to?)
There ain't nobody who can ever understand like I do (I do)
So when you realize you need the one you said goodbye to
Look over your shoulder, boy, and you know who'll be there
You know I'm gonna be right there, right there
When there's nobody else in the world you can put your trust in
Who ya gonna run to?
And you find all the haters around ya that don't mean nothing
Looking back, it's hard for me to see
Just how I coulda been so blind
Like an actor on a movie screen
You played the part with every line
Well, every story doesn't have a happy ending
Sometimes a flower doesn't grow
I hope you understand the message that I'm sending
But boy, I think you need to know
(Coulda been the one)
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had, boy
Now it's just too bad, boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun
'Cause you coulda been the one
There's nothing left to say
Coulda been the one
Coulda been, shoulda been, baby
My momma didn't raise no fool
She said play with fire, you get burned
You laughed at me, I laugh at you
Now it seems the tables turned
I must admit, I really thought you had potential
But I could not have been more wrong
I need somebody I can trust with his essentials
You had your chance, but now I'm long gone
Coulda been the one, baby
You played yourself, boy
And there is no denying it
It's just the way the story goes
You made your bed, boy
Better go and lie in it
But know that you'll be lying there alone
Coulda been, shoulda been
Another day another reminder that your not here with me
I watch the snowflakes falling from the sky then I get lost in memories
The time we tried to build a snowman, the time we tried to count the stars
Its crazy how we didn't know that wed ever be apart
I can hear the music playing
See the lights upon the tree
I can feel the joy in every soul
But for me its incomplete
And I try my best to play the part
But no matter what I do
No it just don't feel like Christmas, without you
Another tear, another regret boy, that your so far away
Can it be, that it was only last year we shared that Christmas day?
Remember when we took the sleigh ride, remember singing by the fire?
Theres to much that's in the daylight, I keep reliving you and I
Time to try to build a snowman, the time we try to count the stars
Its crazy how we didn't know that wed ever be apart!
I can feel the joy in every soul, but for me its incomplete
No it just don't feel like Christmas, no it just don't feel like Christmas, without you
See I tried but it just ain't right, without you
None
Gotta be the big bang

As I was walkin' down the road to Bethlehem one night
I looked up to the sky and there I saw a wondrous sight
A star was shining brighter than I'd ever seen before
And a host of angels sang to me, never heard a song so pure
They said don't be afraid, we bring good news to all the world
With great tidings of joy for every boy and every girl
A child is born
On this holy night
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
So come to see
Mary's sweet baby
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully
Oh yeah
As I went down into the town to see what I could see
Three mighty kings with golden rings came ridin' up to me
They said they seek the child who was born beneath the star
Of all the kings this one would be the mightiest by far
So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come
And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah....
Can’t no bitch with no bills on her list tell me how to run my agenda
Who are these dudes still yelling from their rooms staying home with their moms like a husband, oh
Little bag niggas don’t associate with ‘em
Wanna be a god but still on the true religion
Can’t come, nope
Put my hand up on the boat
You are not from the land I swim from
No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Please don’t insult my intelligence
My mindset is greater than your relevance
I, couldn't get a hold of your name there
Can't stay long 'cause the money's on hold and I gotta pick it up like daycare
You know I gotta pick it up I don't play fair
Gotta pick it up from the floor
Gonna make it hard for these hating ass niggas to ignore
Never give a nigga your location
Who's been giving niggas admiration?
I don't really know
Fraud ass niggas who be like that
Men runnin' up behind another man
Crowd full of bros I don't wanna get to know
I got blood 
Nonsense, nonsense
Nonsense
If you're gonna run with the bulls better walk with  I gotta know what to with no lights out
Commas on the way, niggas wanna hang, all I'm gonna say when they try to lay the pipe down, is
Nope, your credit ain't shit
Four/five lots and my new whip still won't fit
Fuck are you to me?
Same hoes mad in the back ain't know who they wanna be
Any bitch alive with a conscience knows
I'ma be around for a while now
Can't blame me if your nigga don't be giving you down time like he used to
Lately I been in  no bluetooth
I been in the cut getting C-notes
You be in the cut giving deep throat
Gotta pick it up
(Intro)

It’s the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I’ve gotta let it go
I stepped in the dance
Looking for you
That's when
I felt you on my shoulder
The red light came on
And I knew it
Time to wine down
And find ourselves a corner
Six pack with braids and green eyes
I told myself
Girl damn he's too fly
His jeans fit just right
With the nice lean
Tell him upclose
Now let's sing the chorus
If you like what you see
Then you have to let me know
Put your hand pon it
And then we dip it low
Tip pon toe
Now it's time to  it slow,  it slow now
Put your hand on her back
And pull her in close
 here we go now
I cannot front
I've been on you
The way that you move
Makes me light blue
If you keep talking like that in my ear
I'm about to put it on you I swear
 this basement
And go somewhere and kick it
It's getting crowded and it's hot
So tell me are you with it
But there will be no hitting
Wait hold up let me finish
I've got something for you
Since last week
I've been waiting on you my love
And I'm going crazy
Now your here
You can show me just how you do
I've been waiting on you
Now you're here
How you do
 (x2)
Get up, stand up
Throw your hands up high
We'll set it off tonight
Wake up everybody, get up out of your seat
No more holdin' back now, are you feelin' this heat?
So tell the DJ turn it up until you're satisfied
And if they try to shut us down it's gonna be a fight
Wake up all you playas, spend your money tonight
Ladies are you with me? Are you feelin' this vibe?
The party can't get started 'til you get on the floor
So check your wiggles at the door, tell me what you waitin' for?
I want to love you and treat you right
I want to love you every day and every night
We'll be together with a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
We'll share the same room
For Jah provide the bread
Is this love, is this love, is this love
Love that I'm feeling?
Is this love, love, love
I want to know, want to know, want to know now
I got to know, got to know, got to know now
I-I-I-I-I-I, I'm willing and able
So I throw my cards on your table
I want to love you
I want to love and treat, love and treat you right
We'll be together
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter, yeah
Of my single bed
We'll share the same room, yeah
Oh yes I know, yes I know, yes I know now

No way we're gonna live forever
So we just gotta live life better
Life better, no, no, no, no, no-no

Lyric for this song have yet to be released
Please check back once the song has been released
With you I'll always share
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Cause you know how to give me that
No baby, just one, one, one, one
I want you to love me like I'm a hot ride
Be thinking of me
Doing what you like
So boy, forget about the world, 'cause it's gon' be me and you tonight
Then I'ma make you swallow your pride, ooh
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Take it like a thief in the night
Make me feel right
You can come inside
Be my prisoner for the night, ooh
It's over, it's over, it's over now
It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over now
Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
But now it's time to go
That was quite a show
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Grab your clothes and get gone (get gone)
Before the sprinklers come on (come on)
This just looks like a re-run
Please, what else is on? (on)
(Take it, take it, baby, baby)
Giddy-up, time to get it up
You say you a rude boy
(Rude boy)
(Boy)
Come here rude boy, boy, can you get it up?
Give it to me, baby like boom, boom, boom
If you got it I need it and I'ma put it down
Boy, is you big enough?
Now the pain is my pleasure, 'cause nothing could measure
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Na-na-na, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon
Make my body say, "Ah"
[Post-Chorus: Ester Dean / 
Rihanna & Ester Dean
Na-na-na-na, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving
He says, "Close your eyes"
Sometimes it helps
Pull the trigger
And you can see my heart
Said I’m terrified
What's wrong with me?
Why do I feel like this?
(I'm going crazy now..)
No more gas, in the red
Can't even get it started
Nothing heard, nothing said
Can't even speak about it
All my life on my head
Don't want to think about it
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah
It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
It's too close for comfort
Your mind's in Disturbia
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
(Your mind is in) Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
I gotta get out
Or figure this  out
I've been trying to remain tame
But I'm struggling
If you can't go, oh, oh
I think I'm gonna oh, oh, oh
The-the-the-the-the-the hottest
The hottest bitch in heels right here
Tougher than a lion, ain't gon' need to try it
All-black on, blacked-out shades, blacked-out Maybach
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
I'ma rock this shit like fashion, as in going til they say stop
And my, runway never looked so clear, but the hottest bitch in heels right here
No fear, and while you're getting your cry on, I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal, I better let you know
All up on it, know you want to clone it
Who think they test me now, run through your town, I shut it down
I can't just let you run up on me like that, all on me like that
Never, have I ever, been a size 10 in my whole life
So I made it even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mm
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid
My new nickname is "You Idiot"
That's what my friends are calling me when
They're telling me "Let go, he is not the one."
But you insist, on repeatedly trying, to tell me lies
Shut up and drive (drive, drive, drive)
Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive
Now shut up and drive (drive, drive, drive)
So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for
‘Cause your Maybach, ain't got what I got (get it get it)
I ain't even worried, so step inside and ride (ride, ride, ride, ride, ride)
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way
Hands way up
But babe, the wait is over, over
Baby, baby, baby, baby, put the work
Damn I'm glad I picked ya, took a chance on love
Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you (goes to you)
Now it's time to go
What you lookin’ at now, baby?
Won't you use your own mind, oh
I’ve been all alone, right, baby
Can't do a sober drive, no
Fall in love in November nights
Cold weather in the winter time, oh, oh
Guess you know when the time is right
Let’s go on a little joyride, oh
Livin’ life, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Tell me what you’re lookin’ at, baby
Been in this club for a long time, no
Need another shot now, baby
Roll another joint, let go
I been rock n’ rollin’ with my ex
We’ve been gettin’ closer to the X
We be always poppin’ like the X
Crossin' out the haters with a X
La, la, la, la, la, la
They don't know, know, know, know
Story goes, I don't know
Story goes, I don't know, oh, oh, oh
Sorry though, sorry though, sorry though
I don't know
Don't watch me, don't watch me
Watch me, don't watch me
Yeah, story goes, I don't know
He been gone since 3:30
Been coming home lately at 3:30
But now I'm hot and baby, you gon' get it
I'm breaking dishes up in here, all night
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights
I'mma fight a man tonight, I'mma fight a man tonight
I'mma fight a man, a man, a m-a-n
A man, a man, a m-a-n
I guess I'll just wait it out
I’m supposed to be in love but I’m numb again
Na-na-na, c'mon
Na-na-na-na, c'mon
Na-na-na
You wanna stay but won't tell me
So maybe if you say it (say it)
Tell me what it is you like (like)
Baby baby don't be shy (shy)
Maybe you can spend the night (night)
But if you playing (not with it)
'Cause you know what I wanna hear (hear)
Say it, that'll make it more clear (clear)
So baby why won't you (say it)
Say it (say it)
So maybe if you say it
Have the same thing on, about a week-long
Black shoes, black jeans, white tee on
Caught the last flight home, you're working too long
No rest, no stress, no phone call
You wouldn't believe me if I told you myself
See if believing I can show you myself
But I already remember where I woke up yesterday
15 cigarettes in my ashtray I am using
That's what happens when you
Sleep all day, play all night
That's my life, that's the life
New York days, L.A. nights
A-all night, up all night
All night, up all night
That's my life, all day all night
Up till sunshine, watching the sunrise
Pull it in, sending chills up my spine
Can't find no time to rest my tired eyes
Can't see, can't see a straight line
You wouldn't believe me if I told you myself
See if believing I can show you myself
But I already remember where I woke up yesterday
Oh, oh!
Sleep all day, play all night (oh, all night)
That's my life, that's the life (that's my life)
New York days, L.A. nights (oh, oh)
That's my life, that's the life (that's the life)
A-all night, up all night (all night, all night)
All night, up all night (oh)
New York days, L.A. nights (L.A. nights, yeah)
That's my life, all day all night (hey)
A-all night, up all night (oh yeah, all right)
All night, up all night (all night, up all night)
A-all night, up all night (oh)
All night, up all night (up all night)
Type to get my—the type to get my
Type to get upset—cry—cry
Type to get upset—get
You won't see me cry (cry, cry, cry)
Cry, cry, cry
When you walked out of my life (you'll never see me cry)
Cry, all my life
I feel like a monster, whoa
(I'm going crazy now...)
Disturbia, Disturbia
Or figure this shit out
I feel like a monster
Come on!
Get up right now
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Tomorrow way too far away, ohhh
(Get up right now)
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
And to him I just can't be true
I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
I don't wanna do this anymore, woah
We got our guns
Ohh we got our guns, got our guns
Trip and it's going down, down, down
I'm ready to roll, girl I'm with you
Bitch, I'm with you if you with, if you with me
Load it, reload it
Let's go
Gangster for life
I promise I'm standing high
We driving by with them headlights off
Guns (check) Girls (check)
I promise I'll stand and fight
Loosen the buttons and undo my shirt
I put in work
Did more than called upon, more than deserved
But it taught me before a decision, ask this question first
Chances of living, question existing
Take off my cool
Do the mistakes I make
Make me a fool or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, 'round of applause
Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose
It's entertainment, is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers, whether win or lose, is...
Entertaining is something I do for a living, it's not who I am
I laugh, I get mad, I hurt
But when you're in the spotlight everything seems good
Cause I have to always keep my guard up
Ooo yeah
I'm going crazy
Disturbia, it's like the darkness is the light
So, shine bright tonight
Shining bright like a diamond
Please, what else is on?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I-I-I-I told ya
I told ya baby
(I don't really give a fuck)
I'm a rockstar
Hey baby, I'm a rockstar
Big cities (big cities)
Bright lights (bright lights)
Sleep all day (all day)
Baby, I'm a rockstar
Hey baby, it's big cities (big cities)
Chest to chest
Nose to nose
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
So, how come when I reach out my finger, it feels like more than distance between us?
Cheek to cheek
You were sleeping next to me
With the curtains drawn, and a little last night on these sheets
So, how come when I reach out my finger, it seem like more than distance between us?
California dreaming
'Cause this thing is ready
Oh oh
Where I'm goin', I don't need my brakes
The lovers need to clear the road
Where we're going, we don't need no brakes
Because this thing is ready to blow
And don't care
All we know is we was at home cause you left us there
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
And once we've gone
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care
He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be getting it on
(Easy for a good girl to go bad)
Ain't no other other like you
You da one
One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one
Yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah (oh yeah yeah yeah)
Oh yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) That Rihanna reign just don't let up
Brilliant, resilient, fan mail from 27 million
Yeah, I see you aiming at my pedestal, so I think I gotta let you know
The flow so tight and the beat so sick
Y'all never thought she now come hard like this
And take no shit, we reads that shit
We did the dirt 'cause she's the princess
She hard, we hard, this beat so beat
Jump Smokers in the world, let them hate so hard
Barbados, back to Chi-town, say yes, Rihanna came to shut it down
Where them girls talking trash?
Where them bloggers at?
Where your lighters at?
So, I'm giving up this war
Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave (oh, no)
Haunted (haunted), haunted, ooh
So, how come when I reach out my finger, it seems like more than distance between us?
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
We say welcome to the nadhouse
Come on, come on, come on (Welcome to the mad house)
To the mad house
House
Come on, come on in (Mad house)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na (Welcome to the mad house)
I'm a rockstar (rockstar)
Hey baby, I'm a rockstar (rockstar)
Baby, I'm a rockstar (rockstar)
Long nights (long nights)
Long nights, long nights, long nights
Long nights, long nights, long nights, long nights
I told ya
In a hopeless place
We found love
Your love is mine
Mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine
Oh, I didn't mean to fall in deep, but I’ve no regrets
You tried to push me down, you tried to keep me possessed
I gave you my heart, you took the key
But now I paid my debt, it's time I left
And I don't need someone who makes me feel so bad
And I’ve just enough left to help me pack my bags
Yes, I have found something I thought I lost
I found me, I found faith, I found trust
You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won't take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now
I won't take it lying down
All it takes is one bold move to change everything
All it takes is loving you to forget, forgive
But I'm having some kind of breakthrough
I'm ready to live
I don’t need someone who makes me feel so bad
Can’t you see I won't take this lying down?
I won’t take it lying down
Come up to my room you sexy little thing
You really got me on it, I must confess
Come up to my room you sexy little thing (Sexy little thing)
And let's play a game (yeah), I won't be a tease (no baby)
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing (oh oh oh)
I wish you would push up on me (Oh oh)
There's no way I’m turning back (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
'Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it
C’mon, c’mon, c'mon
C’mon, c'mon, c'mon
It's exactly what I’ve been yearning for
Rockstar
California wishing on these stars
[Drop: Dave Audé & 
One, one, one, one, one
All I've got
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
But boy you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
Now baby it's killing me
Today will be better babe
So happy and lovely hey, hey, hey
But you're all that I have that I had
You had your Guess jeans on looking sexy, oh no
[Outro: Rihanna / 
Rihanna & will.i.am
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
Somebody tell me
Baby, uh, uh, I told ya baby
Uh, uh, I told ya baby
Uh oh, I told ya baby
Uh, uh, I told ya, I told ya
I told ya,  I told ya
Oh, oh, oh-ow
Please don’t stop the music
It’s gettin' late, I'm making my way over to my favorite place
Baby, I’ma say your aura is incredible
If you don’t have to go, don't
But now we’re rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty
We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now we’re face to face
Baby, are you ready? 'Cause it's getting close
Got my middle finger up, I don't really give a 
(I don't really give a )
Six-inch walker, big  talker
(S-S-S and M-M-M)
Ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
Thinking about everything we become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to dead this
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent
You had me thinking
You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I
Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say
Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget
Took me swimming
In the ocean
Made me feel like I'm floating
You think I'm playing
When you know it's the truth
All my kisses
And my loving
I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out
You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to
You would phone me
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises you made me
And you can see my heart....
Uh oh, uh oh
