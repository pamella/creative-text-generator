When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, “let it be”
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted
, 
there is still a chance that they will see
Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on 'til tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, "let it be"
Oh there will be an answer, let it be
Shoot me
Here come old flat-top, he come groovin' up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeball, he one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please
He wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola
He say, "I know you, you know me"
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Come together, right now
Over me
Verse 3
He bag production, he got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease
Right!
Come, come, come, come
He roller-coaster, he got early warnin'
He got muddy water, he one mojo filter
He say, "One and one and one is three."
Got to be good-lookin' 'cause he's so hard to see
Ugh!
Come together, yeah
Come together
Hey Jude,
 
don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na na na na na na na na na na
Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
(Let it out and let it in)
Remember (Hey Jude) to let her into your heart
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Na na na na na na na na na yeah
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
(
Whoa, fucking hell!
)
Better better better better better better,

Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, hmm-hmm
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around, now it may show
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
Here comes the sun, doo da doo doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Little darling, the smile's returning to their faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear
I read the news today—oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on
*Alarm clock rings*
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly
I'm crying
Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus,
goo goo g'joob
Mister City policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I'm crying
Yellow-matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain
I am the egg man
(now good sir, what are you?)
They are the egg men
(a poor man, made tame to fortune's blows)
goo goo goo joob
(good pity)
G'goo goo g'joob
Expert, textpert, choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
(ho ho ho, hee hee hee, ha ha ha)
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
Semolina pilchard
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob
Goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob, g'goo
Joob! Joob! Joob!
Joob! Joob! Joob! Joob! Joob!
Joob! Joob!
Umpa, umpa, stick it up your jumper
Everybody's got one, everybody's got one
“Villain, take my Purse. If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my Body
And give the Letters which thou findst about me
To Edmund Earl of Gloucester: seek him out upon the English Party. Oh, untimely death, death–”
“I know thee well, a serviceable Villain; as duteous to the Vices of thy Mistress as badness would desire.”
“What, is he dead?”
“Sit you down, Father; rest you.”
There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
Where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world, and I notice it's turning
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you
(I look) Look at you all
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe
Jai Guru Deva
Let me take you down, 
'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, 
and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think a "no", I mean, a "yes", but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree
Cranberry sauce
Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well
My Michelle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble
I love you, I love you, I love you
That's all I want to say
Until I find a way
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
I need to, I need to, I need to
I need to make you see
Oh, what you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean
I love you
I want you, I want you, I want you
I think you know by now
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do I'm telling you so you'll understand
And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
Billy Shears!
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?
No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
I just need someone to love
Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends
(Help!) I need somebody
(Help!) Not just anybody
(Help!) You know I need someone
(Help!)
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before
When I was younger, so much younger than today
Help me? Help me? Ooh
Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah

Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store (Chu chu chu)
Buys a twenty carat golden ring (Ring)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her, she begins to sing (Sing)

In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand (Arm, leg)
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band (Yes!)

I wanna hold your hand
Oh, please, say to me
You'll let me be your man
And please, say to me

I can't hide
Yeah, you

I want to hold your hand
Feel that somethin'
I once had a girl
Or should I say, she once had me?
She showed me her room
"Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?"
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on the rug
Biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two
And then she said, "It's time for bed"
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke
I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
Full steam ahead Mister Boatswain, full steam ahead
Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye sir, aye-aye
Captain! Captain!
As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us (Everyone of us) has all we need (Has all we need)
Sky of blue (Sky of blue) and sea of green (Sea of green)
In our yellow (In our yellow) submarine (Submarine, ha-ha!)
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Nobody ever loved me like she does
Oh, she does
Yeah, she does
And if somebody loved me like she do me
Oh, she do me
Yes, she does
I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that has no past (Seeking past)
And from the first time that she really done me
Oh, she done me
She done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me let down
Can you dig it? Don't let me down
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Whoo!
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way, the paper bag was on my knee
Man, I had a dreadful flight
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the U.S.S.R. (yeah)
Been away so long, I hardly knew the place
Gee, it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey, disconnect the phone
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S.S.R
Well, the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind
Oh, come on!
Yeah, I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Oh show me round your snow-peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm
I'm back in the U.S.S.R. (hey)
Oh, let me tell you, honey
Hey, I'm back, I'm back in the U.S.S.R
Hey, it's so good to be home
Yeah, back in the U.S.S.R
Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon
And Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe-down
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, 
I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able
"
And now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival
C'mon, Rocky boy
She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh yeah
She's well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust
(...down)
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Happiness is a warm gun (bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, momma (bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
When I hold you in my arms (ooh, oh, yeah)
And I feel my finger on your trigger (ooh, oh, yeah)
I know nobody can do me no harm (ooh, oh, yeah)
Because
(Happiness) is a warm gun momma (bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is (bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun (bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Well, don't you know that happiness is a warm gun momma?
(Is a warm gun, yeah)
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
It was twenty years ago today
When Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you (Wooo!)
Don't ever leave me alone
When you told me, you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me, that you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly fell down and died
(Believe me, darling!)
When you told me (Woo!) you didn't need me anymore
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
I'll never let you down
(Oh! Believe me, darling)
Love, love, love
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
Nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
 (
All together now
 (Everybody)
(Yesterday)
(Oh yeah)
(She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Oh, yesterday)
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a 
mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny Lane
When I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop, and I turn, and I go for a ride
'Til I get to the bottom, and I see you again!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Well, do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on, tell me the answer!
Well, you may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer
Now, Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Woo!
Oh, will you, won't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer!
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer
Look out!
Ooh!
'Cause here she comes
And I stop, and I turn, and I go for a ride
And I get to the bottom, and I see you again!
Well, do you, don't you want me to make you?
Tell me, tell me, tell me your answer!
Well look out! Helter skelter!
She's coming down fast!
Yes, she is!
Yes, she is
Coming down fast
Oh, yeah, Helter Skelter
Wooh!
I got blisters on my fingers!
Joan was quizzical;
Studied pataphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
Back in school again
Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay
When the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times "I must not be so, o, o, o"
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind
(Do-do-do-do)
P. C. 31 said, "We caught a dirty one,"
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures
, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie
Screaming from the gallery, say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind
Came down upon his head
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Made sure that he was dead
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oa
(Silver hammer man)
Aah!
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out
Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
You say you got a real solution
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
We're all doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait
You say you'll change the constitution
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Alright, alright
Alright, alright!
The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear, 
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way
Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me waiting)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, alright
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?
Love you, love you
Love
And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
He’d let us in, knows where we’ve been
In his octopus’s garden in the shade
I’d ask my friends to come and see
An octopus’s garden with me
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus’s garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can’t be found
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves (Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they’re happy and they’re safe (Happy and they’re safe)
We would be so happy, you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
In an octopus’s garden with you
She loves you,
yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You think you've lost your love
Well, I saw her yesterday
It's you she's thinking of
And she told me what to say
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad
She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind
But now she said she knows
You're not the hurting kind
And you know you should be glad, ooh
With a love like that
You know you should be glad
You know it's up to you
I think it's only fair
Pride can hurt you, too
Apologise to her
Because she loves you
She loves you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Spoken Intro: Alistair Taylor & 
George Martin

...bottle of claret for you if I'd realised. I'd forgotten all about it George, I'm sorry
Well do next time
Will you forgive me?
Mmmyes
Cheeky bitch
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number
Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen time your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for
Number 9, number 9
Who's to know?
Who was to know?
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9
I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever you're doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives
Right! Right!
Right, right, right, right!
I've missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with, like, wow!
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rogue doctors have brought this specimen
I have nobody's short-cuts, aha
With the situation
They are standing still
Upon the telegram
Ooh ooh
Ooh
A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low
Alright!
So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So instead I'd marry, join the bloody navy and went to sea
Block that kick, block that kick!
In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling
Um da
Aaah
How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming
Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building
Onion soup
Industrial output
Financial imbalance
Thrusting it between his shoulder blades
The Watusi
The Twist
El Dorado
Take this brother, may it serve you well
Maybe it's nothing
What? What? Oh
Maybe even then
Exposure could be difficult thing
It's quick like rush for peace is
Because it's so much
It was like being naked
If you become naked
Hold that line, hold that line!
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow 
lorry
slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Yes, it did
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to Heaven
Because the world is round, it turns me on
Because the world is round
Because the wind is high, it blows my mind
Because the wind is high
Love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you
Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue
1, 2, 3, 4!
Well, she was just 17, if you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another? (Ooh)
When I saw her standing there?
Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Woo)
When I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Well, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another (Woo)
Since I saw her standing there
Oh, we danced through the night
Now I'll never dance with another (Woo)
Oh, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
When I'm home, everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah!
Ah!
When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling  you holding me tight
You know I feel alright
Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes down the stairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (
We gave her everything money could buy
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband, Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade
She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied (Bye-bye)
She's leaving home (Bye-bye)
You say yes, I say no
You say stop and I say go go go, oh no
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
I say high, you say low
You say why and I say I don't know, oh no
(Hello, goodbye, hello, goodbye) Hello, hello
(Hello, goodbye) I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
(Hello, goodbye)
Why why why why why why do you say goodbye?
Goodbye, bye bye bye bye
Oh no
You say yes (I say yes)
I say no (But I may mean no)
You say stop (I can stay)
And I say go go go (Till it's time to go)
Oh, oh no
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello, oh, oh
Hello
Hela, heba helloa
Hela, heba helloa, cha cha cha
Hela, heba helloa, woo!
Hela, heba helloa, hela!
Hela, heba helloa, woo-hoo!
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being
That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing
That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing
But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living
Or play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning
Aaah, here come the sun king
Here come the sun king
Everybody's laughing
Everybody's happy
Quando para mucho mi amore de felice corazón
Mundo paparazzi mi amore chicka ferdy parasol
Cuesto obrigado tanta mucho que canite carousel
We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew
Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?
When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see 
we're all one
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
I want you, I want you so bad
I want you, I want you so bad, it's driving me mad
It's driving me mad
I want you, I want you so bad, babe
It's driving me...
She's so heavy
Heavy (Heavy, heavy)
She's so heavy (Heavy, heavy)
I want you, you know I want you so bad, babe
I want you, you know I want you so bad, it's driving me mad
She's so...
Well, shake it up, baby, now (Shake it up, baby)
Twist and shout (Twist and shout)
C'mon c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby, now (Come on baby)
Come on and work it on out (Work it on out)
Well, work it on out (Work it on out)
You know you look so good (Look so good)
You know you got me goin', now (Got me goin')
Just like I knew you would (Like I knew you would)
You know you twist your little girl (Twist, little girl)
You know you twist so fine (Twist so fine)
Come on and twist a little closer, now (Twist a little closer)
And let me know that you're mine (Let me know you're mine)
Baby, now (Shake it up, baby)
Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby, now (Shake it up baby)
Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby, now (Shake it up, baby)
It's getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school (No, I can't complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (No, I can't complain)
You're holding me down (Ah-ah), turning me 'round (Ah-oh)
Filling me up with your rules (Fool, you fool)
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can
Getting so much better all the time!
(Better, better, better)
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (Fool, you fool)
I admit it's getting better (Better)
Yes, I admit it's getting better (Better)
I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is 
on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no
I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh, he was such a stupid git
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane!
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
Monsieur, monsieur, monsieur, how about another one?
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much, it makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day
Ah, girl
Girl, girl
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the Earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
[Bridge: John Lennon, 
Paul McCartney & George Harrison
She's the kind of girl who puts you down
Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit
When friends are there, you feel a fool
Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh
Girl
Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?
To lead a better life I need my love to be here
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
I will be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere
Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around
Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
{Instrumental bridge}
And nobody seems to like him
they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
Round and round and round and round and round
And he never listens to them, 
he knows that they're the fools
They don't like him
The fool on the hill sees the sun going down
Oh (Round and round and round)
Oh
Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you
And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone, she doesn't need him
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her
I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her
She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her
A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
"Listen to that, Mal
Oh look out! It's-"
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob
Oh yeah
Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to, I will
For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same
Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know, I will
I will
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, the world is at your command
He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere man can you see me at all?
Nowhere man, don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand
One, two, three, four
One, two...  (One, two, three, four)
Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
Should five percent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
If you drive a car, car, I'll tax the street
If you try to sit, sit, I'll tax your seat
If you get too cold, cold, I'll tax the heat
If you take a walk, walk, I'll tax your feet
Taxman
Don't ask me what I want it for
(Haha, Mr. Wilson)
If you don't want to pay some more
(Haha, Mr. Heath)
Now my advice for those who die
(Taxman!)
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause I'm the taxman
And you're working for no one but me (Taxman!)
I Dig a Pygmy by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids
Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats
Two of us riding nowhere, spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving, not arriving
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're going home
Two of us sending postcards, writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches, lifting latches
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
Better believe it
Goodbye
They say it's your birthday
Well, it's my birthday too, yeah
We're gonna have a good time
I'm glad it's your birthday
Happy birthday to you
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
Yes, we're going to a party, party
I would like you to dance (Birthday)
Take a cha-cha-cha-chance (Birthday)
Dance, yeah, woo, come on (Come on)
Woo, dance! Dance!
[Verse: Paul McCartney & John Lennon, 
Paul McCartney
Love, love me do
You know I love you
I'll always be true
So please, 
love me do
Whoa, love me do
[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon, 
Someone to love
Somebody new
Someone like you
Yeah, love me do
Whoa, oh, love me do
Why don't you love me do
Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac
 said, 
"You've got to go back"
You know they didn't even give us a chance
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
"You can make it O.K
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain"
Drove from Paris to the 
Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said, "Say what you doing in bed?"
I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace"
Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
"Poor boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you
But your soul - think!"
Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspaper said, "She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag"
Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said, "We wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back"
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling
Stay in bed, float up stream
Dear Prudence
Won't you come out to play?
Greet the brand new day, hey
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful, and so are you
Open up your eyes
See the sunny skies
The wind is low, the birds will sing
That you are part of everything
Won't you open up your eyes?
Look around, round, round
Look around
Let me see you smile
Like a little child
The clouds will be a daisy chain
So let me see you smile again
Won't you let me see you smile?
Greet the brand new day
I told you 'bout Strawberry Fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything flows
Looking through the bent back tulips
To see how the other half lives
Looking through a glass onion
I told you 'bout the walrus and me, man
You know that we're as close as can be, man
Well, here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul
Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I told you 'bout the fool on the hill
I tell you, man, he living there still
Well, here's another place you can be
Listen to me
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In his way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home everyday
And I'll send all my loving to you
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
All my loving I will send to you
All my loving, darling I'll be true
All my loving, all my loving ooh
Ooh, I need your love, babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love, babe
Just like I need you
Hold me, love me
I ain't got nothing but love, babe
Eight days a week
Love you everyday, girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say girl
Love you all the time
I ain't got nothing but love, girl
Is not enough to show I care
Ooh I need your love, babe
One thing I can say, girl
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia
Julia, Julia
Ocean child calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes
Windy smile calls me
Her hair of floating sky is shimmering
Glimmering in the sun
Morning moon, touch me
When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia
Julia, sleeping sand
Silent cloud, touch me
Hmm hmm hmm
Calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia
Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes "The News of the World"
Yes, you could say she was attractively built
(Hey!) Great!
Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out
For taking the easy way out, now
She was a day tripper
A one way ticket, yeah
It took me so long
To find out, and I found out
She's a big teaser
She took me half the way there
She took me half the way there, now
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands
She only played one night stands, now
A Sunday driver, yeah
Day tripper
Day tripper, yeah
Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love
I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend
If it makes you feel alright
I'll get you anything, my friend
'Cause I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love
I'll give you all I've got to give
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
But what I got I'll give to you
I don't care too much for money
Can't buy me love, everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love, no-no-no, no!
Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy
Ow!
Buy me love, everybody tells me so
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Silly people run around, they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby, can't you see
I wanna be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
And maybe I'll love you
I told that girl that my prospects were good
And she said baby, it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah!
I told that girl I can start right away
When she said listen, babe, I got something to say
I got no car and it's breakin' my heart
But I've found a driver and that's a start
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Have you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies, life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in
Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in
In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their life, there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking!
Everywhere there's lots of piggies living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner with their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon
One more time
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man
Last night, I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl
Come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you
You don't need me to show the way, love
Why do I always have to say, love?
Come on (Come on), Come on (Come on)
I don't want to sound complaining
But you know there's always rain in my heart (in my heart)
I do all the pleasing with you it's so hard to reason
With you, whoa yeah, why do you make me blue?
I know I never even try girl
Come on (Come on) Come on (Come on)
Please, please me, whoa yeah, like I please you
Me, whoa yeah, like I please you
Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
Sexy Sadie, what have you done?
You made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie, oh, what have you done?
Sexy Sadie, you broke the rules
You laid it down for all to see
Sexy Sadie, oh, you broke the rules
One sunny day, the world was waiting for a lover (Sexy Sadie)
She came along to turn on everyone
Sexy Sadie, the greatest of them all (Sexy Sadie, she's the greatest)
Sexy Sadie, how did you know?
The world was waiting just for you
Sexy Sadie, oh, how did you know?
Sexy Sadie, you'll get yours yet
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie, oh, you'll get yours yet
We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table
(Sexy Sadie)
Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie, she's the latest and the greatest of them all
Ooh woo
She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me? (Lovely Rita maid! Ahh-ah-ah)
Rita!
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you
Lovely Rita meter maid (Lovely meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid (Rita meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid (Oh Lovely Rita, meter meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out
Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight or say good night
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her
If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
I think I'm going to be sad, I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care
She said that living with me is bringing her down, yeah
She would never be free when I was around
I don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think twice, she ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
The girl that's driving me mad is going away, yeah
Oh, she's got a ticket to ride
My baby don't care
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents, he always took his mum
He's the all American, bullet-headed, Saxon mother's son
All the children sing
Deep in the jungle, where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce," his mummy butted in
"If looks could kill
, it would have been us instead of him"
Eh, up!
Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's Good News
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down the blues
You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You'll shout aloud
You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now, turns so sour
We all know Ob-La-Di-Bla-Da
But can you show me, where you are?
Yes, you'll have to have them all pulled out
Two, three...
Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why
In the morning
In the evening
My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth
I'm lonely
The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bones
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones
Lonely
Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll
Yeah, want to die
She said, "I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad"
And she's making me feel like I've never been born
I said, "who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born"
She said, "you don't understand what I've said"
I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong"
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right
I said, "even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born"
She said, "you don't understand what I said"
I know what it is to be sad
I know what it's like to be dead"
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life
What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there
Every single day of my life
And suddenly I see you
Did I tell you I need you
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
But she changes from day to day
I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeah
Someday I'm going to make her mine
Take two
Okay
We all wanna change the world
Don't you know that you can count me out, in
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Well, all I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait
We'd all love to change your head
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow
All, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl
Well you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line
Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead
I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Or you won't know where I am
Na, na, na
It's been a long, long, long time
How could I ever have lost you
When I loved you?
It took a long, long, long time
Now I'm so happy I found you
How I love you
So many tears I was searching
So many tears I was wasting, oh, oh
Now I can see you, be you
How can I ever misplace you?
How I want you
Oh, I love you
You know that I need you
Paperback writer (writer, writer)
Dear Sir or Madam, will you read my book?
It took me years to write, will you take a look?
It's based on a novel by a man named Lear
And I need a job, so I want to be a paperback writer
Paperback writer!
It's a dirty story of a dirty man
And his clinging wife doesn't understand
His son is working for the Daily Mail
It's a steady job, but he wants to be a paperback writer
It's a thousand pages, give or take a few (Frère)
I'll be writing more in a week or two (Jacques)
I could make it longer if you like the style (Frère)
I can change it 'round and I want to be a paperback writer (Jacques)
If you really like it, you can have the rights (Frère)
It could make a million for you overnight (Jacques)
If you must return it, you can send it here (Frère)
But I need a break, and I want to be a paperback writer (Jacques)
Paperback writer, paperback writer
Martha, my dear
Though I spend my days in conversation
Please, remember me
Martha, my love
Don't forget me
Hold your head up, you silly girl
Look what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl
Take a good look around you
Take a good look, you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be for each other
Hold your hand out you silly girl
See what you've done
You have always been my inspiration
Please, be good to me
You tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me
You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see me
When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round
When your bird is broken
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken
You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me
You can't hear me

Sweet Loretta Fart she thought she was a cleaner
But she was a frying pan
Sweet Rosetta Martin... Rosetta

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo
Go home
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Yeah, get back, get back
[Outro: Paul McCartney &

Thanks, Moe
I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope we passed the audition
I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, oh yeah, that's right
I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide
Oh no, no, oh no! Oh no
Yeah, yeah! I've got a feeling, yeah!
Oh please, believe me, 
I'd hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah!
And if you leave me I won't be late again
Oh no, oh no! Oh no
I've got a feeling
All these years I've been wandering around
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody who looked like you!
I've got a feeling, that keeps me on my toes
Oh yeah, oh yeah (oh yeah!)
I've got a feeling, I think that everybody knows
Oh yeah, oh yeah! Oh yeah
Everybody had a hard year
Everybody had a good time
Everybody had a wet dream
Everybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, (oh yeah) oh yeah, oh yeah (yeah)
Everybody had a good year
Everybody let their hair down
Everybody pulled their socks up (yeah)
Everybody put their foot down, oh yeah
Yeah, woo-hoo!
I've got a feeling (Everybody had a good year)
A feeling deep inside
 (Everybody had a hard time)
Oh yeah (Everybody had a wet dream)
Oh yeah (Everybody saw the sunshine)
I've got a feeling 
(Everybody had a good year)
A feeling I can't hide (Everybody let their hair down)
Oh no (Everybody pulled their socks up)
Oh no, no (Everybody put their foot down, oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah!
I've got a feeling (Oh yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Oh my soul, so hard.)
Good morning, good morning
Good morning
Nothing to do to save his life, call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been?
Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
People running round, it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and Meet the Wife
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts, you start to flirt, now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say, but it's okay
Good...
Good morning, good morning, good
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut (Ja! Ja!)
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut (Ja!)
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut (Gewözei teuer)
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, good morning
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Now the moon begins to shine
Mmm
Good night
Good night, everybody
Everybody, everywhere
I dig a pony
Well, you can celebrate anything you want
Yes, you can celebrate anything you want
Oh!
I do a 
road hog
Well, you can penetrate any place you go
Yes, you can penetrate any place you go
I told you so
All I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
I pick a moon dog
Well, you can radiate everything you are
Yes, you can radiate everything you are
Oh, now
I roll a stoney
Well, you can imitate everyone you know
Yes, you can imitate everyone you know
Ooh, now
I feel the wind blow
Well, you can indicate everything you see
Yes, you can indicate anything you see
Oh now
I load a lorry
Well, you can syndicate any boat you row
Yeah, you can syndicate any boat you row
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere
Yeah, oh, baby, you've changed
Ah, I'm looking through you
Yeah, I'm looking through you
You changed, you changed, you changed, you changed
All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid
Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart, I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met, she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mmm-mmm-mmm-m'mmm-mmm
Had it been another day I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight
Di-di-di-di'n'di
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again
I have never known the like of this I've been alone
And I have missed things and kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite like this
Da-da-n'da-da'n'da
Mmm-mmm-mmm-da-da-da
Oh, fallin', yes I am fallin'
Sheepdog
Standing in the rain

Doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?
Child-like
No one understands
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me
Big man (Yeah)
Walking in the park
Wigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue
Wahoo woof! Woof!
Hey bulldog! Hey bulldog!
Hey man, what's that boy?
Woof!
What do you say?
I said "woof!"
You know anymore?
Wooaah ha ha ha!
You've got it, that's it, you had it!
That's it, man, woo!
That's it! You've got it!
Don't look at me man, I only have ten children
Ah ho! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Quiet boy, quiet!
Quiet!
Hey bulldog!
You'll never know how much I really love you
You'll never know how much I really care
Listen
Do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell? Whoa oh, oh
Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you, ooh
Listen (Do da do)
Do you want to know a secret? (Do da do)
Do you promise not to tell? (Do da do) Whoa oh, oh
Closer (Do da do)
Let me whisper in your ear (Do da do)
I've known the secret for a week or two
Nobody knows, just we two
Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me
Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man
A lifetime is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
There's people standing round
Who'll screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all their sins you'll see
I'll make love to you
If you want me to
There's a fog upon L.A
And my friends have lost their way
"We'll be over soon", they said
Now they've lost themselves instead
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
For I may be asleep
Well, it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet
Now it's past my bed I know (Know)
And I'd really like to go (Go)
Soon will be the break of day (Day)
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way (Way)
Or I may be asleep
Don't be long, don't be long
If the rain comes
They run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
When the sun shines
They slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down) And sip their lemonade
(When the sun shines down) When the sun shines
When the sun shines (Sun shines)
Rain
I don't mind
Shine
The weather's fine
I can show you
That when it starts to rain
(When the rain comes down) Everything's the same
(When the rain comes down) I can show you
 (Show you)
Can you hear me
That when it rains and shines
(When it rains and shines) It's just a state of mind
(When it rains and shines) Can you hear me
 (Hear me)

One day, you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
Some day, you'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end, you will know
Oh-oh-oh
One day, you'll find that I have gone
Yeah, tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be?
And have you traveled very far?
Far as the eye can see
How often have you been there?
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there?
Nothing that doesn't show
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play?
Baby, baby, you're a rich man
Oh, baby, you're a rich man
Baby, baby you're a rich man, too
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king
So cry baby cry
The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday
The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the 
local Bird and Bee
At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark
Cry cry cry baby
Can you take me back where I came from
Can you take me back
Brother, can you take me back
Mm, can you take me where I came from
Why don't we d-do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road
No one will be watching us
Why don't we d-do it, do it in the road?
Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long, I'm sitting singing songs for everyone
Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies
Find me in my field of grass
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun
All through the day
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
All through the night
Now they're frightened of leaving it
Everyone's weaving it
Coming on strong all the time
I me mine
I-I-me-me-mine
All I can hear
Even those tears
No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through your life
When I call you up, your line's engaged
I have heard enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)
I don't know why you should want to hide
But I can't get through, my hands are tied
I won't want to stay, I don't have much to say
But I get turned away
And you won't see me (you won't see me)
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
Ooooh oh la la-la
(Roll up! Roll up for the magical mystery tour!
Step right this way!)
Roll up, roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up (and that's an invitation), roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up (to make a reservation), roll up for the mystery tour
The magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away
Roll up (we've got everything you need), roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up (satisfaction guaranteed), roll up for the mystery tour
The magical mystery tour is hoping to take you away
Hoping to take you away
A mystery trip
Aaaah... the magical mystery tour
The magical mystery tour is coming to take you away
Coming to take you away
The magical mystery tour is dying to take you away
Dying to take you away, take you today
Good day sunshine
I need to laugh, and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good, in a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day
We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground
And then we lie, beneath a shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine
I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do
Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
So I should have realized a lot of things before
If this is love you've got to give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more
You're going to say you love me too
You love me too, you love me too
You love me too
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so
Always made me feel so free
Ah
Oooooo
Free
Made for John Lennon
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, it's such a joy, come on, it's such a joy
Come on, let's take it easy, come on let's take it easy
Take it easy
Everybody's got something to hide
Except for me and my monkey
The deeper you go, the higher you fly
The higher you fly, the deeper you go
So come on, come on
Come on, let's make it easy, come on, let's take it easy
Except for me and my monkey, yeah
Your inside is out when your outside is in
Your outside is in when your inside is out
So come on (woo!), come on (woo!)
Come on, let's make it easy, come on, let's make it easy
Make it easy (woo!)
Hey!
Yeah!
Anna
You come and ask me, girl
To set you free, girl
You say he loves you more than me, so I will set you free
Go with him (Anna)
Girl, before you go now
I want you to know, now
That I still love you so, but if he loves you more
Go with him
All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
Oh, now, but every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free
I've been searching for a girl to love me like I love you
But let me tell you now
But every girl I've ever had, breaks my heart and leave me sad
You can go with him, girl (Anna)
I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery
Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should
I listen for your footsteps coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door
I don't hear it--does it mean you don't love me any more?
I hear the clock a'ticking on the mantel shelf
See the hands a'moving, but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight, and why I'm by myself
I don't see you, does it mean you don't love me any more?
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash, and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two
I said that's alright, I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you
You'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
She was a working girl North of England way
Now she's hit the big time in the U.S.A
And if she could only hear me, this is what I'd say
Honey Pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home
Oh, honey pie, my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song
You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee
Oh, Honey Pie, you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Honey pie, come back to me
Ooh, yeah
I like it like that, oh ah
I like this kind of hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me, Hollywood blues
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me?
Tee, tee, tee
Now Honey Pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
Ooh, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Honey Pie, Honey Pie
I get high when I see you go by
My oh my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?
Yes it's so hard loving you, loving you
As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you
Treasure these few words 'til we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S. I love you
You, you, you
I'll be coming home again to you, love
And 'til the day I do, love
As I write this letter (oh)
(You know I want you to)
Remember that I'll always (yeah)
Ring, my friend I said you'd call
Doctor Robert
Day or night he'll be there any time at all
You're a new and better man
He helps you to understand
He does everything he can
If you're down he'll pick you up
Take a drink from his special cup
He's a man you must believe
Helping anyone in need
No one can succeed like
Well, well, well, you're feeling fine
Well, well, well, he'll make you
My friend works for the National Health
You'll pay money just to see yourself
With Doctor Robert
I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away
When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
I'll make you maybe next time around
But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I could wait forever, I've got time
Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand
I've got time
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know (your mother should)
Your mother should know (know)
Sing it again
Lift up your hearts and sing me a song
Da da dada da da da dada dada dada da da
Da dada da da
Da da da da da dum dum da
If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love, from me to you
I've got everything that you want
Like a heart that's oh so true
I got arms that long to hold you
And keep you by my side
I got lips that long to kiss you
And keep you satisfied, 
oooh
From me, to you
And keep you satisfied, oooh
To you, to you, to you
You don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you
Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes
You told me
Oh yes, you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you
But when you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this, I just can't go on anymore
Baby's good to me, you know
She's happy as can be, you know
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
Baby says she's mine, you know
She tells me all the time, you know
I'm so glad that she's my little girl
She's so glad, she's telling all the world
That her baby buys her things, you know
He buys her diamond rings, you know
She's in love with me and I feel fine, mmm
She's in love with me and I feel fine
I don't like you, but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh
You treat me badly, I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me), baby!
I don't want you, but I need you
Don't want to kiss you, but I need to
You do me wrong now, my love is strong now
I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me...
Tighter!
I want to leave you, don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend another day here
I want to split now, I just can't quit now
You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me), baby! (baby!)
Is just hold me (Please), hold me (Squeeze), hold me, hold me...
That boy took my love away
Though he'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again
That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again
Oh, and this boy would be happy
Just to love you, but oh my
That boy won't be happy
Till he's seen you cry
This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again
This boy
This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see your face
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
If I were you, I'd realise that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply
No reply, no reply
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end
And I lost someone who's near to me
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?
What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realise I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all
I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la
It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
(Sha la la la la)
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart
Uh, oh
Many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do?
Can't help myself
'Cause, baby, it's you (Sha la la la la la la)
Baby, it's you (Sha la la la la la la)
You should hear what they say about you, "cheat," "cheat"
They say, they say you never never never ever been true
(Cheat, cheat)
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm going to love you any old way
What can I do? And it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
What can I do? When it's true
Don't leave me all alone (Sha la la la la la la)
Come on home (Sha la la la la la la)
'Cause, baby, it's you
(Queen says no to pot-smoking FBI members)
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living every moment, girl, for you
(Bop, bop cat bop)
(Go, Johnny, go)
(Them ol' 12-bar blues)
(Elmore James got nothing on this, baby)
I've loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me and that's all you had to do
I feel it now I hope you feel it too
I'm livin' the blues
Can I have a little more?
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, I love you
A, B, C, D
Can I bring my friend to tea?
E, F, G, H, I, J, I love you
(Bom bom bom bompa bom) Sail the ship
(Bompa bom) Chop the tree
(Bompa bom) Skip the rope
(Bompa bom) Look at me
(All together now) All together now
Black, white, green, red
Can I take my friend to bed?
Pink, brown, yellow, orange and blue, I love you
If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah
I want a love that's right
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now, I'm telling you
You know you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo
It won't be the same now when I'm with you
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me, hey
I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me
I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late, hey
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue
You know who loves you
You know
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I've got it, the word is good
Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I'm thinking of
Everywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and the bad books that I have read
Now that I know what I feel must be right
I'm here to show everybody the light
Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of
And the only word is love
Say the word, love
My baby said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling 'round, only fooling 'round with me
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman said "you've got the wrong location"
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong
Well, she said she's travelling on the one after 909
She said she's travelling on the one after 909
Railman says you've got the wrong location
Said she's travelling on the one after 9-0
Oh, Danny boy, the old savanna calling
(Wait!)
Oh yes, wait a minute, Mister Postman
Wait, Mister Postman
(Mister Postman, look and see)
Oh yeah!
(Is there a letter in your bag for me)
Please, please, Mister Postman
(I've been waiting a long, long time)
(Since I heard from that girl of mine)
There must be some word someday
From my girlfriend so far away
Please, Mister Postman look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me
I've been standing here waiting, Mister Postman
So patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Saying she's returning home to me
Please, Mister Postman!
So many days you passed me by
See the tear standing in my eye
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leaving me a card or a letter
Mister Postman!
Look and see
If there's a letter, oh yeah, for me
I've been waiting such a long time
Since I heard from that girlfriend of mine
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait a minute, wait a minute)
(Mister Postman)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Oh yeah, you got to
Check it and see
One more time for me
Mister Postman
Deliver the letter, the sooner the better
Ooh! (Oh yeah!) You gotta
Gotta wait a minute, wait a minute
Aah! (Oh yeah!) You gotta
Wait, wait a minute
(Oh yeah, ooh!)
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried
But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay
I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me
The world is treating me bad, misery
I'm the kind of guy
Who never used to cry
I've lost her now for sure
I won't see her no more
It's gonna be a drag, misery
I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one
Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery
She’ll remember and she’ll miss her only one, lonely one
Without her I will be in misery (Oh oh oh)
In misery (Ooh ooh)
My misery (La la la la la la)
Like a rolling stone
Like the FBI
And the CIA
And the BBC
B.B. King
And Doris Day
Matt Busby, dig it, dig it
Dig it, dig it, dig it
That was "Can You Dig It" by Georgie Wood
And now we'd like to do "Hark the Angels Come"
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
Floating down the stream of time from life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much
Sail me on a silver sun, where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea
It's all to much for me to see
The more I learn, the less I know
But what I do is all too much
It's too much
Ah, it's too much
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
You're too much, ah
We all get too much
Too much, too much, too much
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind
The other day I saw you as I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you, I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
I met you in the morning waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning, I can see that I was blind
I used to think of no one else but you were just the same
You didn't even think of me as someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?
You are tearing me apart
Well, gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today
You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues (
Woo
I think I caught the arthritis
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Rocking in two by two
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Rocking in two by two (
Well early in the morning
I'm a-giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime
The music will never stop
Dig to these rhythm and blues
Honey pie
I love you, honey pie
Oh, dirty Maggie Mae, they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street anymore
Oh, the judge he guilty found her for robbing a 
homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbing Maggie Mae
This is a part of Liverpool, they returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up
And started playing that rock and roll music
Got to be rock and roll music
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And in the mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano
Oh, you got rock 'n roll music
They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally
Well I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part and I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally
I been told when a boy kiss a girl
Take a trip around the world
Hey, hey 
(Bop shuop, m'bop bop shuop)
(Bop shuop)
Yeah, she say you do 
My girl says when I kiss her lips
Gets a thrill through her fingertips
Well, I talk about boys 
(yeah, yeah, boys)
Don't ya know I mean boys? 
Well, I talk about boys, now 
Aaah, boys 
What a bundle of joy! 
Alright, George!
Oh, oh, ah yeah boys 
Ooh, boys 
Ah ha 
Well I talk about boys now 
I’ve got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
I’m going to let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that
Well, it’s the second time I’ve caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it’s a sin
I think I'll let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face
So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings, I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down (Let you down)
Oh, you can’t do that!
(You can't do that)
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you
Every night when everybody has fun
Here am I sitting all on my own
Since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home
Every night the tears come down from my eyes
Every day I've done nothing but cry
So every day we'll be happy I know
Now I know that you won't leave me no more
It won't be long yeah, yeah
You're gonna lose that girl (Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
If you don't take her out tonight
She's gonna change her mind (She's gonna change her mind)
And I will take her out tonight
And I will treat her kind
 (I'm gonna treat her kind)
If you don't treat her right, my friend
You're gonna find her gone, (You're gonna find her gone)
'Cause I will treat her right, and then
You'll be the lonely one
 (You're not the only one)
You're gonna loooooooo... (Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
I'll make a point
Of taking her away from you
(Watch what you do)
The way you treat her
What else can I do?
(You're gonna lose that girl)
And I will treat her kind (I'm gonna treat her kind)
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
I don't want to kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
I've discovered I'm in love with you
You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinkin' of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today
You say you'll be mine, girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
A taste of honey!
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey (A taste of honey)
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart
I'll come back (He'll come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you
I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I—I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue
Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry
And in time, you'll understand the reason why
If I cry it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more—misery
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you
You
We said our goodbyes (ah, the night before)
Love was in your eyes (ah, the night before)
Now today I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before
Were you telling lies (ah, the night before?)
Was I so unwise, ah (the night before?)
When I held you near you were so sincere
Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry
We said our goodbye (ah, the night before)
Yes
Like the night before
There—
There's a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone
I think of you
And things you do
Go round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"
In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
There is a place
None
You know if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again
I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time, I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend
I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me too
But I got a big surprise
This time I will try to show that I'm
I wanna go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you
You, if you break my heart I'll go
Since she's been gone
I want no one to talk to me
It's not the same, but I'm to blame, it's plain to see
So go away, leave me alone
Don't bother me
I can't believe that she would leave me on my own
It's just not right, when every night I'm all alone
I've got no time for you right now
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me
But till she's here
Please, don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't-
Whenever I want you around, yeah
All I got to do
Is call you on the phone
And you'll come running home
Yeah, that's all I got to do
And when I, I want to kiss you, yeah
Is whisper in your ear
The words you long to hear
And I'll be kissin' you
And the same goes for me
Whenever you want me at all
I'll be here, yes, I will
Whenever you call
You just got to call on me, yeah
You just got to call on me
And you'll come runnin' home
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
We just wrote it like that
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no one there
It feels so right now, hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one, and then I might
Never be the lonely one
So hold (hold), me tight (me tight)
Tonight (tonight), tonight (tonight)
It's you, you, you, you
Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight
Making love to only you
It's you, you, you
You don't know
What it means to hold you tight
Being here alone tonight with you
It feels so right
Now hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might
Tonight tonight
It's you, you, you, you, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Oo-ooh, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
Chains, well I can't break away from these chains
Can't run around, 'cause I'm not free
Whoa, oh, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah
I wanna tell you, pretty baby
I think you're fine
I'd like to love you
But, darlin', I'm imprisoned by these
Whoa, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
Please believe me when I tell you
Your lips are sweet
I'd like to kiss them
But I can't break away from all of these
Chains, chains of love
Chains of love
The best things in life are free
But you can keep 'em for the birds and bees
Now, give me money (That's what I want)
That's what I want (That's what I want)
That's what I want, yeah (That's what I want)
That's what I want
Your lovin' gives me a thrill
But your lovin' don't pay my bills
That's what I want, oh yeah (That's what I want)
Money don't get everything, it's true
What it don't get, I can't use
That's what I want, whoa
Well, now, give me money (That's what I want)
Whole lot of money (That's what I want)
Wow, yeah, I wanna be free (That's what I want)
Oh, a lot of money (That's what I want)
Wow, yeah, you know I need money (That's what I want)
Oh, now, give me money (That's what I want)
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Well I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me, oh, so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan
If there's something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologize
If you don't, I really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes
Well I beg you on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do
'Cause I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back,
 she's dressed in black
I think of her, but she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim, she thinks of him
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear what can I do?
And though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black
Hold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you
Let me hear you say the words I long to hear
Darling, when you're near
(She's got the devil in her heart)
But her eyes, they tantalize
(She's going to tear your heart apart)
Oh, her lips, they really thrill me
I'll take my chances, for romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me
No, no, this I can't believe
No, no, nay will she deceive
I can't believe that she'll ever, ever go
Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so
Listen, can't you see?
Oh, no, no, no, this I can't believe
Don't take chances if your romance is
So important to you
No, no, no, no, this I can't believe
'Cause she's an angel sent to me
No, she's an angel sent to me
Without going out of my door
I can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of Heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Without going out of your door
You can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of your window
You could know the ways of Heaven
Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing
Cha-cha-boom!
Besame besame mucho
Each time I bring you a kiss
I hear music divine
So besame besame mucho
I love you forever
Say that you'll always be mine
Dearest one, if you should leave me
Then each little dream will take wings
And my life would be through
Oh besame besame mucho
Ooh I love you forever
You make all my dreams come true
Ooh this joy is something new
My arms they're holding you
I never knew this thrill before
Who ever thought I'd be
Holding you close to me
Whispering, "It's you I adore"
Oh this joy is something new
Oh so dearest one, if you should leave me
Oh so besame besame mucho
Make all my dreams come true
Ooh love you for ever
I want to be your lover baby
I want to be your man
Love you like no other baby
Like no other can
I want to be your man, I want to be your man
Tell me that you love me baby
Let me understand
Though you've gone away this morning
You'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
You've tried before to leave me
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
NARRATOR:
Once upon a time, or maybe twice, there was an unearthly paradise called Pepperland. Eighty thousand leagues beneath the sea it lay... or lie, I'm not too sure.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Pepperland is a tickle of joy on the blue belly of the universe. It must be scratched.
Right, Max?
MAX:
Yes, Your Blueness.
What?! We Meanies only take NO for an answer. Is that understood, Max?
No, Your Blueness.
That's better. Are the troops in readiness?
The Bonkers?
No.
Clowns?
Snapping Turks?
Anti-music missiles?
The dreadful Flying Glove?
Splendid! Today, Pepperland goes blooey! Fire!
FRED:
The Meanies are coming! The Meanies are coming!
Glove, Glove, come here, Glove! Look out there, and what do you see? Tell him, Max.
Someone running, Glove.
Yes. Well, you'll soon put a stop to that, won't you, Glovey? Go, Glove, point! And having pointed, pounce down! I haven't laughed so much since Pompeii! What?! What?! What?! The Glove is losing his touch. Do your worst! Explode them!
FRED :
It's not polite to point!
Thing of beauty... Destroy it for ever!
Sir, Sir, the Meanies are coming!
MAYOR:
Not here, young Fred. They wouldn't dare.
They would. They are. What are you going to do?
Finish the quartet.
BLUE MEANIES:
Fire!
Trio, sir.
Duet, sir.
MAYOR
Duet?
Solo!
Young Fred, the Blue Meanies are coming!
4 scores and 32 bars ago our forefathers...
Our quartet?
And foremothers...
Another quartet?
Made it in this yellow submarine...
What, that little thing?
To Pepperland. Climb aboard, young Fred.
But, sir, I can't even make my soap float.
I'm appointing you Lord Admiral.
Lord Admiral? In that event, yes.
Hurry, Young Fred. Go! Get help!
Where should I go?
No time for trivialities.
CREDITS
In our Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine
…
Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain.
Full speed ahead.
Full speed it is, sir.
Action stations! Action stations!
Aye, sir, aye.
Captain, Captain!
Every one of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
We all live in a Yellow Submarine,
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine,
Ah, look at all the lonely people
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?
Writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear
No-one comes near
where do they all come from?
No-one was saved
RINGO:
Who... is me? Liverpool can be a lonely place on a Saturday night. And this is only Thursday morning. Compared with my life, Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl. Nothing ever happens to me. I feel like an old, splintered drumstick. I'd jump into the River Mersey, but it looks like rain. Nothing ever happens to me.
BOBBY:
Puss, puss-puss. Puss, puss, puss. Here, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy.  Ahem, er...
Would you believe me if I told you I was being followed by a yellow submarine?
No, I would not.
Oh yeah, I didn't think you would.
I could have sworn there was a yellow submarine. But that isn't logical, is it? It must have been one of them unidentified flying cupcakes or a figment of my imagination.
But I don't have an imagination.
Help, help, help!
RINGO :
Thanks, I don't need any.
Help! Won't you please, please help me?
Be specific.
... music ... submarine ... Blue Meanies!!!
What you need is...
'H' for hurry, 'E' for ergent, 'L' for love me and 'P' for p-p-p-p-please help.
VOZ:
Hiya, baby!
Your story has touched my heart. Jump in, we'll get my friends.
Bless you!
Did I sneeze?
Just park it here.
I'll just park it here.
What would your friends be doing here?
Displaying.
Displaying what?
Displaying around.
Can't we take one of these?
No, Fred, I only work with me mates.
Frankenstein?
I used to go out with his sister.
His sister?
Yeah. Phyllis. Hey, I wonder what would happen if I pulled this lever.
You mustn't do that.
Can't help it. I'm a born lever-puller.
JOHN:
Ringo, I've just had the strangest dream.
I warned you not to eat on an empty stomach. Now listen to old Fred.
What do you think?
I think he needs a rehearsal.
When do we leave?
Let's get the other two, John.
What day is it?
Sitar-day.
Then George will be here.
George, what are you doing up there?
GEORGE :
Now, what is it, Ringo? Is there a matter you'd like to take up or down?
This chap here...
...Blue Meanies!!!
GEORGE:
You're nuts, the pair of you.
Wait a minute, that's my car.
How do you know it's your car?
I'd know it anywhere.
What's it look like, then?
It's red with yellow wheels. I mean, blue with orange wheels.
It's all in the mind.
Come on, move over, I'm driving.
I got here first.
RINGO/GEORGE:
I'll drive, if you like... No, you sit in the middle... I'm sitting in the middle... You said you were driving... I am driving... I'll get in the back, then.
Do you think we're interrupting something?
I think so. We'd better find Paul, hadn't we?
Try one of those doors.
Yes, they do look very nice, don't they?
Yes, they do.
They do, though, don't they?
Don't dey, dough?
Dough?
Don't ask. Dat's dough.
PAUL:
What's the matter, folks?
Blue Meanies.
Well, lads, what do you think?
JOHN :
I think that...
Remember, there'll be rough seas ahead. So, what do you think?
Well, then, um...
Pounding, overwhelming waves. What do you think of that?
Well, I think that...
As a matter of fact, I...
ALL BEATLES:
I think...
Well?
I've forgotten.
Right, then, let's get this vessel shipshape.
I kind of like the way it is, submarine shape.
We see a series of landscapes. We hear the end of “A day in the life”.
So, this is a submarine.
Soft, isn't it?
Not if you're on the bottom.
All right, lads, time to stow the gab and turn to.
Groovy. How do you start this thing?
It starts with a Blue Meanie attack.
Supposing there's no Blue Meanies in the neighbourhood?
Then you start looking for a switch.
Perhaps this is it.
One, two, three, four / Can I have a little more?
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten / I love you
A, B, C, D / Can I bring my friend to tea?
E, F, G, H, I, J / I love you
Sail the ship
Chop the tree
Skip the rope
Look at me
All together now (all together now)…
Black, white, green, red / Can I take my friend to bed?
Pink, brown, yellow, orange and blue / I love you (All together now)
All together now (all together now),
all together now (all together now)...
What time is it?
It's time to time.
Look, the hands are slowing down.
Do you ever get the feeling...
Yeah.
… that things aren't as rosy as they appear to be under the surface?
What's happening, John?
Well, in my humble opinion, we've become involved in Einstein's time-space continuum theory.
All right.
Relatively speaking, that is.
Of course. Maybe time's gone on strike.
What for?
Shorter hours.
I don't blame it. It must be very tiring being time, mustn't it?
JOHN & PAUL:
Why?
It's a twenty-four hour day, isn't it?
You surprise me, Ringo.
Dealing in abstracts.
Just because I'm a drummer... I don't half feel funny.
PAUL :
You're not half the lad you used to be.
GEORGE 
Look, everything's getting bigger.
It's not. It's us that are getting smaller...
I want my mam.
And younger. There you are, lads. Old Fred will get you out of all this.
RINGO 
Look at that!
It's all a load of Father Xmas's.
It's not. It's Father Time.
How do you know?
I read it in a book.
I don't want to alarm you, but the years are going backwards.
What's that mean, old Fred?
It means if we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we'll all disappear up our own existence.
What are we gonna do, then?
We could always try a few buttons.
Time's fast running out for us, I'm afraid!
Can't we do something to the clock?
What do you mean, John?
Move the hands forward, see what happens.
Clever lad.
Something strange is happening. It's speeding up now.
Funny... a submarine remarkably like our own.
Uncannily.
There's someone in it. Look.
And they're waving.
It's a group of fellas.
Wave back. Maybe we're both part of a vast yellow submarine fleet.
There's only two of us.
Then I would suggest that yonder yellow submarine is one of ourselves…
Going backwards...
… in time!
Look at Ringo.
Oh dear, we're all the same.
Senile delinquents.
And I can hear my beard growing.
We'd better do something.
When I get older, losing my hair
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
You'll be older, too
Sunday mornings, go for a ride
[A text can be read: “sixty-four years is 33.661.440 minutes and one minute is a
long time… Let us demonstrate”.]
in the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
Grandchildren on your knee,
Vera, Chuck and Dave
Indicate precisely
what you mean to say
Give me your answer, fill in a form,
mine forever more
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen, but would you agree that we have been passing through the Sea of Time?
That would explain a few things. I'm glad I'm not young any more. Or was it old?
What kind of a sea is this?
The Sea of Science.
Oh, yeah.
He just wrote it like that
It doesn't really matter
What chords I play
What words I say
Or time of day it is
Cause it's only a Northern Song
What clothes I wear
When it's only a Northern Song
And I told you there's no-one there.
He looks wrong.
He doesn't look at all well.
In fact, he's horrible.
He's so ugly.
ALL:
Really ugly!
Somebody push a button.
There's a cyclops.
Can't be. He's got two eyes.
Then it must be a bi-cyclops.
There's another one.
A whole cyclopedia.
There's a school of whales.
They look a bit old for school.
University, then.
University of Whales. They look like dropouts to me.
You've got to steer clear!
Steer clear?
Yes, steer. Clear?
Yes, dear.
Now, whatever you do, don't touch that button.
Which button?
That one.
This one?
That was the panic button.
Poor Ringo.
Poor lad.
Never did no harm to no-one.
Lads, now Ringo's gone, what are we gonna do?
Learn to sing trios.
No, let's save the poor devil.
I see footsteps.
It's a pair of kinky boot-beasts.
Preparing to attack.
I don't half miss Ringo.
He's far out there.
Always was.
'H' is for hurry!
Here comes Ringo!
There goes Ringo.
It's seen us.
Find a boxing button.
Whoever heard of a boxing button?
Who cares? Find one.
Fire one!
Uh-oh, wrong one.
That.
There goes Ringo again.
Rides well, doesn't he?
'E' is for ergent...
Oh no, not the dreaded vacuum again.
We'll be sucked into oblivion.
Or even further.
Put her in reverse.
So long, sucker.
Too much.
Too soon.
Reverse! Reverse!
Ringo time.
'L' is for love me...
Indians!
Help! Help! 'P' is for please...
So, press a button.
How was it, Ringo?
'Arrowing.
Look who's back. Full speed ahead.
Oh, no.
The motor's packing in.
By all the sea nymphs, we're losing power. We're being swallowed. What shall we do?
Serve tea.
Lovely.
By Neptune's knickerbockers, she's puttered out.
Maybe we should call a road service.
Can't. No road.
And we're not sub-scribers.
JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE:
Subscribers! Oh!
I know something about motors. Let me have a look.
Here.
Is that the motor?
Can't you tell one when you see one?
Of course I can. Let me peruse it.
I think I burned my finger.
Here, lads. Look at this.
What do you think it is?
Nothing.
Looks like nothing.
It's a local inhabitant.
He's probably one of the nothings.
At least that's something. Let's show him our motor.
Steady on. You don't want to show your motor to just anybody.
But this is a nobody.
JEREMY:
Medic, pedic, zed oblique,
orphic, morphic, dorphic, Greek.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
Can you tell us where we're at?
A true Socratic query, that.
And who the Billy Shears are you?
Who? Who indeed am I?
Jeremy?
Hillary?
Boob?
Ph. D?
Who?
Eminent physicist, polyglot classicist,
prize-winning botanist,
hard biting satirist,
talented pianist, good dentist, too.
Lousy poet.
Critic's voice, take your choice.
Must be one of them angry young men.
Or a daffy old creep.
I, daffy old creep?
Do you speak English?
Old English, middle, a dialect, pure...
Well, do you speak English?
You know, I'm not sure.
He's so smart, he doesn't even remember what he knows.
Why don't we show him our motor?
Should we really... show him our motor?
He may not have seen one before.
Turbo-prop, super-combustible spring.
Metrocyclonic and stereophonic,
This motor, I see, has a broken down thing.
He fixed it?
He fixed it.
Great. Let's go.
I must complete my bust, two novels,
finish my blueprints, begin my beguine.
Must you always talk in rhyme?
If I spoke prose, you'd all find out,
I don't know what I talk about.
Hey, fellas. Look.
The footnotes for my 19th book.
This is my standard procedure for doing it.
And while I compose it,
I'm also reviewing it.
A boob for all seasons.
How can he lose?
Were your notices good?
It's my policy never to read my reviews.
There must be a word for what he is.
He's a real Nowhere Man
Sitting in his Nowhere Land
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view,
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere Man, please listen,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
He's as blind as he can be,
Nowhere Man, can you see me at all?
Nowhere Man, don't worry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lends you a hand
He's a real Nowhere Man,
Okay, men, all aboard. Let's go somewhere.
What about him?
He's happy enough going around in circles.
Poor little fella.
I don't know. Ringo's just a sentimentalist.
Look at him. Can't he come with us? 
Mr. Boob, you can come with us, if you like.
You mean, you'd take a Nowhere Man?
Come on, we'll take you somewhere.
JOHN 
Okay, Booby. Down the hatch.
JEREMY :
Down the hatch. A quite curious phrase.
The middle South Midlands
Victorian phase.
It's usage undoubtedly on the increase.
I must work it into
my New Statesman piece.
That's the hatch, friend.
Indeed.
Steady now, crew. Prepare to go forward.
Forward.
Forward!
It's awfully quiet.
What shall we do, Jeremy?
Repair, revive, revamp, renew.
Ipse dixit, just turn the screw.
Log sign, clog sign, big thingamabob.
What's he saying?
What's he doing?
Chewing gum will do the job. A turn of the screw, and all is and all is new.
I can't stop her. 'H' is for hurry, 'E' is for ergent, 'L' is for love me…
'P' is for... goodbye?
That was lovely, Jeremy.
We've lost the sub for good.
Or for bad. Or for worse.
I'm sorry about that.
But he did fix the motor.
Where are we?
It looks like the foothills.
The foothills of what?
The foothills of the headlands.
With tangerine trees
and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you,
you answer quite slowly
Look for the girl with the sun
in her eyes and she's gone
Where rocking horse people
eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles
as you drift past the flowers
Climb in the back with your head
in the clouds and you're gone
With Plasticine porters
with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
Lucy in the sky with diamonds…
Carry on, lads, carry on.
Certainly was carrying on.
I feel a draft.
We must be near the Sea of Holes. Don't you think we should ask somebody for directions?
Excuse us...
Can you tell us the way to Pepperland?
Thanks.
Gosh, look at all this dust? Where did it come from?
A chemical error and quite imprecise. This is a condiment...
Condi...
A spice.
He's right, you know. It's pepper.
Pepper?
Pepper.
John? Paul? George? Is anybody home?
A holey sea. This place reminds me of Blackburn, Lancashire.
Oh, boy...
How many do you think there are in all?
Enough to fill the Albert Hall.
Didn't old Fred mention something about the Sea of Holes just before the Sea of Green?
Through one of them spots must be the Sea of Green. But which? Which one?
Thesis, antithesis, synthesis, causes of causal causation.
Jeremy, what do you know about holes?
There are simply no holes in my education.
You mean you haven't composed a whole book?
Great. What shall we do?
Be empirical. Look.
The booby's making more and more sense.
It's getting better all the time.
Great. Come on, let's all look for the Sea of Green. The Sea of Holes... into the Sea of Green.
Hydrolate, verdant chrysodine.
I think we're near the Sea of Green.
I've got a hole in me pocket.
Where's Jeremy?
He was over there.
He's not here now.
He must have jumped ship, then.
He wouldn't do that. He's our friend. Booby, Jeremy, Hillary, where are you?
Pepperland. A bit salty around the edges. Looks all dingy.
And drab.
And quiet.
Safe at last.
And none the worse for our adventures.
Reminiscent in many ways of the late Mr. Ulysses.
There's an eye in the apples.
There she blows! Lord Mayor, sir... I've made it, I'm back.
Who's this?
Our Lord Mayor. He's been bonked. . Lord Mayor, sir... unbonk yourself. Even a little snatch of a tune might get him up again.
All right, let's sing.
Have you got time to rectify, time to rectify...
Do I hear music? Do I see... young Fred?
You do, Lord Mayor.
Bless my metronome. And did you bring the help?
Yes, yes. Look.
Holy pizzicato, young Fred. It's quite uncanny, your faces...
We're quite cute, really.
You could pass for the originals.
We are the originals.
No, no... Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
They couldn't be much with a name like that. Sergeant Pepper?
FRED
You could impersonate them and rally the land to rebellion.
Where are your instruments?
JOHN
Lost in the Monstrous Sea.
PAUL
Sea of Monsters.
We'll get other instruments, Lord Mayor.
Not a chance. The Meanies captured everything that maketh music.
They hate music that much, do they?
They shrink at the very sound.
Okay, you guys. It's shrinking time in Pepperland.
All people in Pepperland keeps grey and motionless (except for escape from the blue
meanies).
BLUE MEANIE
Aim, fire!
The Beatles hide behind cut-outs.
He reminds me of my old English teacher.
Look, if you must shout, shout quietly.
GEORGE
What do we do?
Coagulate with the crowd.
Cut-outs at the ready.
Then let's cut out.
They come to a high bandstand surrounded by thorns.
What a grand bandstand.
That's where the gear's kept. Come on.
Blue meanies with dogs.
Cavey, cavey.
At dusk.
All right, the coast is clear.
Now's our chance.
RINGO
But how'll we get over?
Easy. Follow me.
They jump the fence of thorns
A-ha! You fools!
The watch fires his machine gun.
The Beatles reach the bandstand moving between asleep blue meanies.
It's not very light in here, is it?
Shh! Keep the noise down.
Look what I found. It's their uniforms.
Nice bit of gear, that.
They'll look great on, eh?
Dey will, won't dey?
Won't dey, dough.
How do I look?
Groovy, groovy. How about me?
RINGO, looking thru the window
Bad scene, lads. We're surrounded.
Oh, heck.
A million billion Meanies.
They're coming this way.
ALL
Hide!
Trying to hide they make a lot of noise.
Do you think they heard us?
I hope not.
What did you say?
SOMEONE
Shhhh!
Good plan.
1:03:22 DAWN, by Grieg.
Look. They're all asleep.
They look cute when they're asleep. Almost human.
Come on. Let's get out of here.
On tiptoe.
They take their instruments and go down the hill.
Tiptoe through the Meanies...
THE OTHER
Shh!
Ringo steps on the bagpipe. Some meanies wake.
Let's exude.
The Beatles are persecuted. Ringo falls down and jumps on the John arms.
Relax, lads. Not a Meanie in sight.
Not even a teeny Meanie.
Not even a teeny-weeny Meanie.
Great.
Oh, look. Breakfast.
I'm dying for a bit of brekky.
George takes an apple. Four tall meanies do the same.
Look out.
A blue meanie heads the four tall meanies.
CHIEF
Sound off, one, two, three, four...
TALL MEANIES
One, two, three, four...
The Beatles, one above the other, march behind the row of tall meanies.
Five.
Five?  Sound off, one, two, three,
four.
One, two, three...
Four.
John eliminates another one.
One, two...
Three.
Three?
Two.
Two?
One.
One?  Are you Bluish? You
don't look Bluish.
Run for it.
The Beatles escape again.
Right, men. We've made it.
Instruments at the ready.
Okay, on the beat. A-one, a-two, a-three, a-four, a-five, a-six…
Hey, can't you make it three?
All right. On the beat of three... A-one, a-two, a-three...
1:06:34 THE BEATLES: SGT. PEPPER’S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND
It was twenty years ago today,
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style,
So may I introduce to you,
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely,
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
It's wonderful to be here,
it's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience,
we'd like to take you home with us
I don't really wanna stop the show,
That the singer's gonna sing a song,
So let me introduce to you,
THE BEATLES: WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS
The inhabitants of Pepperland recover color and smile. Lennon has been presented as Billy Shears, but Ringo’s voice is heard.
01:08:49 THE MEANIES GATHER AROUND THEIR CHIEF
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Ah! The hills are alive...
ASSISTANT
With the sound of music.
The Chief Blue Meanie hits his assistant. Then he gets a tantrum.
Who is responsible for this?
Rimsky Korsakov?
The assistant is shot and kicking, but still resurfaces.
Guy Lombardo?
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE, laughs
My dear friend... let us not forget that heaven is blue.  Tomorrow, the world! Bring in my Bluebird.
PEPPERLAND INHABITANTS
Who? Who? Who?
PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO
The mouth of John expels the question WHO?
A blue big glove crosses the air.
Ah! Here you are, my little Glovey-dovey. Go get thee hence and destroy yon upstarts.  Smash them! Squash them! Crash them! Oblue-terate them!
MEDICAL DOCTOR, as the Chief collapses
Here, your Blueness, have some nasty medicine.
CHIEF, exuberant
The Glove, the Glove, the Glove!
Glove? Glove? Glove?
From the mouth of John emerge the word GLOVE.
He's a clever lad, isn't he?
Open your mouth, it won't hurt.  John, you haven't half got a big mouth, haven't you?
It's easy. All you need is love.
Yes.
And expeles again the word GLOVE, but this time the initial G vanishes.
1:12:02 THE BEATLES : ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE
Love, love, love (x3)
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
All you need is love, love,
Nothing you can know that isn't known,
There's nowhere you can be
that isn't where you're meant to be
All you need is love, (All together now)
All you need is love, (Everybody)
The words emerged from the mouth of John neutralize the glove attacks.
Go, Glove, lovely Glove.
You took the words right out of my mouth, John.
Hey, wait, and watch.  It's all in the mind, you know.
Everything revives in Pepperland. The word NO becomes NOW and then KNOW.
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
The meanies flee and The Beatles are acclaimed by the crowd.
A little bit further they find a blue glass ball.
Hey, that's a funny place to leave a goldfish bowl.
In Pepperland all things are possible.
It's not a goldfish bowl.
Just a big glass bowl, then.
Yes, blue glass.
It must be from Kentucky.
Paul knocks the bowl. Some music starts to sound.
There's something inside.
Four fellas.
What are they doing there?
They're not having a ball, that's for sure.
It can't be.
It's us.
But we're here.
It's Sgt. Pepper's...
Lonely...
Hearts Club...
Band.
The resemblance is truly striking. If I could come in here I think the theory put forward
by Einstein…
PAUL, spoofs an old song called ‘Any old iron’
Any old Ein, any old Ein, any, any, any old Einstein.
… could well be applied here. The people in the ball are obviously extensions of our own personalities, suspended, as it were, in time, frozen in space, according to the now famous Theory of Relativity, which, briefly explained, is simply a matter of taking two eggs...
The other three try to break the ball.
John!
… beating lightly and adding a little salt and pepper...
George?
How do we get them out?
Break the glass.
We can't. It's Beatle-proof.
Nothing is Beatle-proof.
PAUL, to Ringo
Have you got your drumsticks with you? A drum break might shatter it.
No, I haven't.
Have a look in your pocket.
1:15:50 “Baby you’re a rich man” is heard.
I've got a hole in my pocket. I wonder if...
Ringo sticks the hole on the ball. The ball gets empty.
Yeah, it still works.
We take back all we said.
You're a genius.
A sheer genius.
I know, I know, I know.  Like coloured telly.
Like crystal.
They're decanting.
The members of the Band face their peers.
RINGO 2
Hello, brother.
Yeah, without a doubt.
We're the spitting image of each other.
GEORGE 2
Golly, yeah.
I'm led to believe that you're an extension of my personality.
JOHN 2
Yes, I'm your alter-ego man.
And I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob.  I'm glad you asked me that. Because as a matter of fact there's a war on. Then, brothers in war, to the
skirmish must we hence.
Shall we hence?
Let's not waste time sitting on the hence. Beatles to battle. Charge!
The Blue Meanies attack again. The Beatles run for a hide.
We're surrounded.
RINGO, pointing the four-headed dog
Nice dog, though.
The Beatles hide inside a hurdy-gurdy. John turns the crank and sings:
1:17:26 THE BEATLES : HEY BULLDOG
Sheepdog... standing in the rain
Bullfrog... doing it again
Some kind of happiness
is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're
something special when you smile?
Childlike... no one understands
Jack knife... in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence
is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like
to listen to your fears
Big man... walking in the park
Wigwam... frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude
is measured out in you
You think you know me
but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me,
You can talk to me...
if you're lonely you can talk to me
Hey, bulldog (x4)
John to the dog:
What do you say? Sing it.
Do you know any more? Play it!
Todos
Hey, bulldog.
The Beatles escape from the dog and the guards. Ringo finds Jeremy hanging from
the branch of a tree.
Jeremy, can it be you?
JEREMY
Can it be me? I think you'd better
inquire of the guards,
for when I was captured,
they took all my cards.
Shh, that's enough, Jeremy. Come on, the whole world's being attacked.
What do you want me to do?
Do you recommend fisticuffs
versus the guard?
Oh, guard! Blue Meanio!
Left to the nostril, right uppercut,
right to the eyebrow, left to the gut.
Jeremy stumbles into a tree. An apple falls down and knocks out the meanie. Ringo
congratulates Jeremy.
Jeremy!
Come on, Ringo!
The Chief treats to stem the rout.
Get back! Get back! Once more unto the breach, dear Meanies! You're advancing the wrong way! Retreat backwards! Get back there now!
The Chief is swept along.
My kingdom for a horse!  I think I'll tear him up into little pieces.
He does, does he?
I think I'll make a blueburger out of him.
Ha-ha, I don't care what you think.
You don't, eh? We'll soon see about that.
He does in truth seem quite annoyed,
some reference material
before I'm destroyed.
Where ground is soft most often grows,
Arise, arise, arouse, a rose.
A rosy nose?
Speak your last piece!
Peace, peace,
supplant the doom and the gloom.
Turn off what is sour,
turn into a flower and bloom, bloom.
Ha-ha, bloom, ha-ha, bloom,
bloom, bloom...
A lot of pink roses cover the whole body of the Chief. He flees crazy.
First time I saw that Nowhere Man, that nobody, I knew he was somebody.
You're right. Hello there, blue people. Won't you join us? Buck up, and otherwise go
mingle. What do you say?
Max?
MAX
Your Blue... I mean your Newness!
CHIEF, takes some flowers
It's no longer a blue world, Max. Where could we go?
Argentina?
Are you with us? Will you join?
Shall we?
No!...  Yes, your Newness!
CHIEF, smiles
Yes, Max...
JEREMY, close to them
Yes. Oh, yes is a word with a glorious ring,
A true, universal, euphonious thing.
In genders embracing
and chasing of blues,
the very best word
for the whole world to use. Ha-ha!
Yes, let us mix, Max. I've never admitted it before, but my cousin is the Bluebird of
Happiness.
1:24:41 THE BEATLES : IT’S ALL TOO MUCH
When I look into your eyes,
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside,
the more there is to see
All the world is birthday cake,
Everybody dance. Jeremy and the Chief reconcile. The Chief cries of
emotion.
Nice to have the time
to take this opportunity
Time for me to look at you,
and you to look at me
It's all too much for me to see
1:26:55 PAUL, RINGO, GEORGE AND JOHN IN PERSON
Catchy tune, that.
I can't seem to get it out of my head.
Then shake it.
That's what we've been doing all night.
Yeah, it was a great party.
And we brought back lots of lovely souvenirs. Here is the motor.
I've got a little love.
And I've got a hole in my pocket.
A hole?
Half a hole, anyway. I gave the rest to Jeremy.
What can he do with half a hole?
Fix it to keep his mind from wandering.
Look at John, will you?
John has been looping through a telescope.
What's the matter, John? Blue Meanies?
Newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre.
There's only one way to go out.
How's that?
Singing!
One...
Two...
Three...
¡Fire!
1:27:33 THE BEATLES : ALL TOGETHER NOW
1:28:42 CREDITS
For I have got another girl
Another girl
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you
But as from today, well, I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
She's sweeter than all the girls and I met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you, "This time you'd better stop"
Who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend
I don't want to say that I've been unhappy with you
But, as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new
If you let me take your heart I will prove to you
We will never be apart if I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away
If you put your trust in me I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see
Don't you realise now, what you see is me
Tell me what you see
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you?
Hmm
Mr. Moonlight
You came to me one summer night
And from your beam you made my dream
And from the world you sent my girl
And from above you sent us love
And now she is mine
'Cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight
Mr. Moonlight, come again please
Here I am on my knees
Begging if you please
And the night you don't come my way
I'll pray and pray more each day
Oh, I'll pray and pray more each day
Oh I pray and pray more each day
I've got every reason on earth to be mad
Cause I've just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't so I'll cry instead
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
Don't wanna cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away-hey
But I'll come back again someday
And when I do you better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then I'll cry instead
'Cause I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
If you wear red tonight
Remember what I said tonight
For red is the color that my baby wore
And what's more, it's true
Yes it is
Scarlet were the clothes she wore
Everybody knows I'm sure
I would remember all the things we planned
Understand, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is
Oh, yes it is, yeah
"Please don't wear red tonight"
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true
I'm going to tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John
He says he had the misery it but he got a lot of fun
Oh baby
Yeeeah now baby
Woooooh baby
Some fun tonight
I saw Uncle John with long tall Sally
He saw Aunt Mary coming and he ducked back in the alley
Yeeeeah now baby
Well long tall Sally built pretty sweet
She got everything that Uncle John needs
Well, we're going to have some fun tonight
Have some fun tonight
Everything's alright
Have some fun, yeah yeah yeah
We're going to have some fun tonight
Yeah, we'll have some fun, some fun tonight
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
The way you rock and roll
When we do the stroll
Come on, Miss Lizzy
Love me before I grow too old
Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine
You make me dizzy, dizzy Lizzy
Oh girl, you look so fine
Just a-rocking and a-rolling
Girl I said I wish you were mine
Aw!

Run and tell your brother

Girl, I want to marry you
Put your little hand in mine, girl
Girl, you look so fine
You're just a-rocking and a-rolling
Oh I said I wish you were mine
Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there
If you need somebody to love
Just look into my eyes
I'll be there to make you feel right
If you're feeling sorry and sad
I'd really sympathize
Don't you be sad, just call me tonight
If the sun has faded away
I'll try to make it shine
There's nothing I won't do
When you need a shoulder to cry on
I hope it will be mine
Call me tonight, and I'll come to you
Christmas time is here again

O-U-T spells "out"
This is Paul McCartney here. I'd just like to wish you everything you'd wish yourself for Christmas

George Harrison speaking. I'd like to take this opportunity of wishing you a very Merry Christmas, listeners everywhere

Come on if you please
I've got no time for trivialities
I've got a girl who's waiting home for me tonight
When I'm getting home tonight
I'm going to hold her tight
I'm going to love her till the cows come home
I bet I'll love her more
Till I walk out that door
Again
Come on, let me through
I've got so many things I've got to do
I've got no business being here with you
This way
When I get home, yeah
Well how come you say you will when you won't
Say you do, baby, when you don't?
Let me know honey how you feel
Tell the truth now, is love real?
But ah ah well honey don't, well honey don't
Honey don't, honey don't, honey don't
I say you will when you won't, ah ah, honey, don't
Well I love you, baby, and you ought to know
I like the way that you wear your clothes
Everything about you is so doggone sweet
You got that sand all over your feet
But ah ah well honey don't, honey don't
(Ahh rock on George, one time for me!
I feel fine, mmmhm. I said...)
Well sometimes I love you on a Saturday night
Sunday morning you don't look right
You've been out painting the town
Ah ah baby, been stepping around
But ah ah well honey don't, I said honey don't
(Ah rock on George, for Ringo one time! Woo!)
Well honey don't, well honey don't
Uh little, little honey don't
You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry it's through, oh
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, not a second time
Not a second time
No no no no no
When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now
Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, oooh
When I'm with her I'm happy
Just to know that she loves me
Yes, I know that she loves me now
There is one thing I'm sure of
I will love her forever
For I know love will never die
Every little thing
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't
She don't give the boys the eye
She hates to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her
She don't give boys the eye
She will never make me jealous
Gives me all her time as well as
Loving, don't ask me why
She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man
She's a woman
You know my name

Baby, I'm down (I'm really down)
Well baby, I'm down (I'm really down)
Well, baby baby baby (I'm really down)
Oh baby, I'm down
I'm down, down, down, down, down, down
Oh, komm doch, komm zu mir
Du nimmst mir den Verstand
Komm, gib mir deine Hand
Oh, du bist so schön
Schön wie ein Diamant
Ich will mit dir gehen
In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh
Das war noch nie bei einer anderen
Einmal so
I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here, so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone, please let me know
I've had a drink or two, and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her
Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her, I'll be glad
Though I've had a drink or two, and I don't care
Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
You got me running, and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
I've been waiting here for you
Wondering what you're gonna do
And should you need a love that's true
It's me
Please stop your lying, you've got me crying, girl
Hello little girl
When I see you everyday
I say, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When you're passing on your way
When I see you passing by
I cry, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When I try to catch your eye
I send you flowers but you don't care
You never seem to see me standing there
I often wonder what you're thinking of
I hope it's me and love love love
So I hope there'll come a day
When you'll say, "Mm you're my little girl"
It's not the first time that it's happened to me
It's been a long lonely time
And it's funny funny to see that I'm about to lose my mind mind mind
When you say, "Mm mm
You're my little girl, mm mm mm
You're my little girl, mm mm mm"
You're my little girl, oh yeah
You're my little girl
Do do do do do

- Nah, east. Stepney.

20:33 - 20:35
I ordered soup too.
20:35 - 20:48
- Soup!
- Soup.
20:48 - 20:53
Pardon me, sir. That's a very
fascinating ring you've got there.
20:53 - 20:55
- Unless I'm mistaken.
- Is it?
20:55 - 20:59
The dreaded sacred sacrificial
ring of the dread Kaili.
20:59 - 21:00
21:00 - 21:04
Excuse me. if he is to be sacrificed
before Kaili,
21:04 - 21:06
why is he not painted red?
21:06 - 21:14
I've never had the courage to ask him,
but as he's my best friend I will.
21:14 - 21:17
- Whats this? Glasses?
- That's right, sir. Glasses.
21:17 - 21:21
A victim is offered
to the dread Kaili everyday.
21:21 - 21:23
All are happy to go.
21:23 - 21:26
He who wins is privileged to wear
the sacred ring
21:26 - 21:29
from sun to moon,
from moon to sun.
21:29 - 21:33
And at the end of the happy day
he is slaughtered jolly with a knife.
21:33 - 21:38
And sacrificed jolly with a knife,
so I'm told, with that ring.
21:38 - 21:39
Three hours to live.
21:39 - 21:43
- (Man) You have till five o'clock.
- Before a new victim is chosen.
21:43 - 21:46
You are lucky to be chosen!
21:46 - 21:51
My old mum would give her right hand
to be chosen.
21:51 - 21:54
- Whats this?
- A season ticket.
21:54 - 22:00
I like a lot of seasoning in my soup.
22:00 - 22:02
There's somebody been in this soup.
22:02 - 22:06
I got it from this Eastern bird... lady...
in a fan letter.
22:06 - 22:11
I get all sorts.
Rubbish, though, isn't it? Sacrifice.
22:11 - 22:13
No? Come off!
22:13 - 22:17
So, get in touch with your authorities
and send back the ring to this lady,
22:17 - 22:19
who will then go happy to Kaili.
22:19 - 22:22
- Thank you.
- (Bhuta) Three hours.
22:22 - 22:24
There's a footprint in here.
22:24 - 22:28
Here, you have a go.
22:28 - 22:35
(Gasps) Flee!
22:35 - 22:54
(Woman screams)
22:54 - 22:57
We have lots of little problems like this.
Some of them matrimonial.
22:57 - 22:59
22:59 - 23:01
This ring is not stone.
23:01 - 23:12
- I've only got three hours to live.
- Therefore, it must be a metal.
23:12 - 23:17
- I don't know this metal.
- You're not getting anywhere, are you?
23:17 - 23:20
Early days yet, sir.
Therefore it must be an alloy.
23:20 - 23:26
There's a certain amount of hurry up
involved here. My life is in danger.
23:26 - 23:28
Three ten.
23:28 - 23:30
- The wheel.
- Not the wheel.
23:30 - 23:34
Even the Royal House of Hanover
had the wheel, sir.
23:34 - 23:46
23:46 - 23:49
- I've never seen anything like it.
- You've failed.
23:49 - 23:53
- I suggest you see a specialist.
- What kind? Your tools are broken.
23:53 - 23:56
The fire brigade once got my head
out of some railings.
23:56 - 24:01
- Did you want them to?
- No. I left it there when not at school.
24:01 - 24:03
You can see a lot of the world
from railings.
24:03 - 24:09
(Electronic beeping)
24:09 - 24:12
I like operations,
they give you a sense of outlook.
24:12 - 24:14
This won't work.

It could work if the government
would spend more money.
24:17 - 24:20
Made in America you see.
24:20 - 24:22
Another failure.
24:22 - 24:25
The idea is...
The idea as I see it
24:25 - 24:29
is that we expand the molecules
and the ring grows bigger and drops off.
24:29 - 24:33
- Whats your electricity bill like?
- It's sort of a long counterfoil.
24:33 - 24:37
It's not dropping off.
24:37 - 24:41
Voltage!
Voltage... up, up...
24:41 - 24:43
Up, up!
24:43 - 24:46
- Are you sure I'm earthed?
- Oh no, hold on. Thank you.
24:46 - 24:50
Made in America.
Streets ahead of anything we've got.
24:50 - 24:52
This is English.
24:52 - 24:55
- Is it green, the earth in America?
- In some places its brown.
24:55 - 24:57
He's not earthed.
24:57 - 25:04
He's an idiot.
Has a degree in woodwork. I ask you!
25:04 - 25:07
Done.
25:07 - 25:10
- 5... 4...
- Come on.
25:10 - 25:15
3-2-1-go! I observe the procedure.
He'll thank me for it in the end.
25:15 - 25:18
Scientist, you're getting nowhere.
25:18 - 25:22
It's the plugs.
Good British plugs.
25:22 - 25:26
All this America rig. Wrong voltage.
That's what foxes me.
25:26 - 25:28
- How do you feel?
- I used to use my hands.
25:28 - 25:32
He used to use his hands.
25:32 - 25:35
- Will he still be able to drum?
- Did he do a lot of it?
25:35 - 25:41
- Voltage... up!
- I'm no mean hand at the old sticks.
25:41 - 25:42
The voltage, up, up, up!
25:42 - 25:48
- Hey, he's calling you. Up, up, up!
- Up, up, up!
25:48 - 25:52
The bunker!
25:52 - 25:59
(Electronic humming)
25:59 - 26:03
- I can't watch.
- It's working! Give it the gun, Algernon.
26:03 - 26:10
26:10 - 26:12
Stop it!
26:12 - 26:14
It's more than my job's worth!
26:14 - 26:17
He's out to rule the world
if he can get a government grant.
26:17 - 26:31
Outrageous!
You're nothing but a mad scientist!
26:31 - 26:33
Fantastic!
26:33 - 26:37
With a ring like that I could,
dare I say it, rule the world.
26:37 - 26:40
I must have the ring...
Algernon, the laser.
26:40 - 26:44
Get your hands off him
or I'll call the Metropolitan scuffers!
26:44 - 26:46
The laser...
26:46 - 26:50
- Get him off.
- I must have this ring. The laser.
26:50 - 26:55
Halt! Release him or I'll shoot
and I am a dead eyeshot shooting.
26:55 - 27:01
- I've got it.
- Switch off that machine.
27:01 - 27:04
- The laser.
- The laser, yes...
27:04 - 27:07
I'm better with animals
than plugs and transistors.
27:07 - 27:10
MIT was after me,
wanted me to rule the world for them.
27:10 - 27:13
Daddy being the local master
of the hounds.
27:13 - 27:16
That's where I get it from,
my love of animals.
27:16 - 27:20
They trust me.
I should have been in vivisection.
27:20 - 27:24
How do you know we can trust her?
She's had your fingers before, Ringo.
27:24 - 27:28
Well, that was a mistake.
I can vouch for her. We're very close.
27:28 - 27:32
- Lasers ready.
- Get them!
27:32 - 27:35
(Laser Beeps)
27:35 - 27:38
(Bang)
27:38 - 27:42
It's the wrong plug...
Just give me five minutes.
27:42 - 27:50
It's the brain drain.
His brain's draining.

30:03 - 30:07
No! it is Clang, the High Priest,
who is filthy in his ways.

(Posh accent) How do we know
you're not sent by him to nick the ring,
30:10 - 30:13

30:13 - 30:16
- What filthy ways are these?
- You can put that away.
30:16 - 30:21
Until this moment you were safe
because my sister was chosen
30:21 - 30:24
and no other could be sacrificed
to Kaili.

Now my sister is safe and rises up.

That one with the large ned.
35:46 - 35:48
Neb!
And its yours.
35:48 - 35:54
- Keep your hands up.
- How can I get it off with my hands up?
35:54 - 35:56
In the name of science
I demand that ring.
35:56 - 35:57
It's yours!
35:57 - 36:01
- It's worth something.
- A couple of bob, at least.
36:01 - 36:05
Had to do all this myself... Backward
Britain they call us on Wall Street.
36:05 - 36:09
With a ring like that

No, I could not.

Ugh! I'm all sticky. You're all red!

- No that's not me.

76:12 - 76:15
The things we have to do
in these heathen countries.
76:15 - 76:29
There must be an easier way
to set a trap!
76:29 - 76:34
- Easterner speaks with forked tongue.
- What does he say?
76:34 - 76:37
Passing this way with hot foot
to the temple.
76:37 - 76:40
Don't encourage him!
You've got the part, Paul.
76:40 - 76:44
- Dare we ask how you know?
- How! I saw those footprints...
76:44 - 76:47
And this guidebook.
76:47 - 77:03
- To the temple.
- (Whistles)
77:03 - 77:21
After them... slowly!
77:21 - 77:25
- That's not it, is it?
- It's on the map as being here.
77:25 - 77:30
That temple under the rock,
that swimming pool that we came up in...
77:30 - 77:34
- I'm lost!
- This isn't a temple, is it?
77:34 - 77:38
- So this is a famous temple?
- Should be. It's gone.
77:38 - 77:41
I hope that disembowelling thingy
has gone, too.
77:41 - 77:44
- Was there ever a temple here?
- Never, sir.
77:44 - 77:49
Old army place. Well-known
place of retreat for courting couples
77:49 - 77:51
who like the echoes of bugles
as they court.
77:51 - 77:54
That's my theory.
77:54 - 77:56
77:56 - 77:58
- Aren't we going in?
- No, lets not.
77:58 - 78:01
Oh, come on lads,
where's that famous pluck?
78:01 - 78:04
- I haven't got any. Have you, George?
- Did have.
78:04 - 78:08
- I have had.
- I will have.
78:08 - 78:10
He's a bit soft that inspector,
isn't he?
78:10 - 78:12
He never takes his hat off.
78:12 - 78:30
It's very hot over here
for wearing a hat.
78:30 - 78:35
- I'm off.
- Typical!
78:35 - 78:37
78:37 - 78:39
78:39 - 78:44
- Kaili!
78:44 - 78:46
(Electric buzz)
78:46 - 78:50
The fiends! They've electrified
the wire with high tension. HT.
78:50 - 79:06
The fiends!
79:06 - 79:08
(Hollers) Help me!
79:08 - 79:10
Help!
79:10 - 79:12
He's mine!
79:12 - 79:15
79:15 - 79:42
Help me!
79:42 - 79:48
There's one on the back,
but its not the right one.
79:48 - 79:54
Come here, boy! Let me explain.
79:54 - 80:00
This is no time for foolish tricks!
This is a hired car.
80:00 - 80:03
Back up and smash him off.
80:03 - 80:07
(Algernon) Now, this will get him!
80:07 - 80:11
Oh! Never mind. Try again.
80:11 - 80:17
This should give him a headache.
80:17 - 80:20
80:20 - 80:23
- That's done it, he's gone.
- I can't start the car.
80:23 - 80:26
- (Engine splutters)
- Hello.
80:26 - 80:31
Oh, hello! Hang on a minute...
80:31 - 80:36
On, on!
80:36 - 80:38
I seem to be having
a slight difficulty.
80:38 - 80:51
To the right! oh...
80:51 - 80:56
- I think it might be the wrong key.
- On!
80:56 - 80:59
On!
80:59 - 81:04
(Engine starts)
81:04 - 81:20
(Algernon) Got it.
Didn't take long, did it?
81:20 - 81:28
Thanks for the lift, sailor!
81:28 - 81:31
- Where did the thugs go?
- They've vanished.
81:31 - 81:33
- He's got a plan.
- Avery famous plan.
81:33 - 81:35
Superintendent, you've got a plan.
81:35 - 81:37
- Yes...
- Superintendent.
81:37 - 83:21
I've got a plan.
83:21 - 83:23
(Hollers) Ringo!
83:23 - 83:25
Ringo!
83:25 - 83:28
- Ringo!
83:28 - 83:30
83:30 - 83:32
83:32 - 83:34
(Dogs bark)
83:34 - 83:46
83:46 - 83:47
All right, talk!
83:47 - 83:55
We know he's a prisoner,
but where?
83:55 - 83:57
- I'm a perfect surgeon.
- Huh?
83:57 - 84:00
- He was asked to take it up.
84:00 - 84:03
Alas... Scalpel.
84:03 - 84:12
Sca...
84:12 - 84:15
Sand in the generator.
84:15 - 84:18
It gets everywhere. No wonder
I never get anything done.
84:18 - 84:21
Fix it, Algernon.
84:21 - 84:24
You wouldn't want me to go in
with a blunt scalpel.
84:24 - 84:26
Fix it!
84:26 - 84:30
I'm a decent employer,
but he takes advantage of me.
84:30 - 84:37
- It's the heat, it makes him stroppy.
- Luckily.
84:37 - 84:40
I've got some juice.
84:40 - 84:44
(Ringo) I can't understand it. They kept
pulling my nose. Mine of all noses!
84:44 - 84:48
- Distilled from the essence of orchids.
84:48 - 84:52
84:52 - 84:54
- Distilled from the essence...
84:54 - 84:59
Not distilled from the essence of orchids
found only in certain recesses?
84:59 - 85:05
At last! I'll have my just reward.
Give it to me! Sir Tberius Foot Juice!
85:05 - 85:08
- But the ring...
- Who needs it now that I have this.
85:08 - 85:11
- Do you know what this is?
- A Webley automatic...
85:11 - 85:15
It's Nobel Prize juice. Set sail for home,
for England! A jewel set in the sea!
85:15 - 85:18
The government in the palm of my hand.
Whats it say?
85:18 - 85:20
- You're going on a sea voyage...
- No, this!
85:20 - 85:24
- (Algernon) I don't know.
- Haven't you a degree in Eastern?
85:24 - 85:27
- (Algernon) I don't think so.
- Lets get it translated.
85:27 - 85:33
- Now!
- Right!
85:33 - 85:43
- I can't swim.
- What do you mean you can't swim?
85:43 - 85:46
(Clang) Treacherous Woman,
tremble...
85:46 - 85:49
In the name of Preverti,
daughter of the mountains,
85:49 - 85:52
85:52 - 85:55
- Wait till my mates get you.
- I don't think so...
85:55 - 86:00
We've had two battalions flown in
specially to ambush your friends.
86:00 - 86:02
They're quite merciless.
86:02 - 86:08
One word of warning from you
and you die instantly.
86:08 - 86:11
Oh, mother Kaili,
86:11 - 86:13
whose name is the Terrible...
86:13 - 86:15
I'm going to miss the sacrifice.
86:15 - 86:18
(Clang) ...whose name
is the inaccessible,
86:18 - 86:24
whose name is the Black Mother,
mother of darkness!
86:24 - 86:25
We turn our hearts to...
86:25 - 86:27
(Ringo) No!
86:27 - 86:29
(Clang) ...drinker of blood...
86:29 - 86:32
- It's off! I'm saved!
- ...killer of demons,
86:32 - 86:36
drink of this vessel,
gorge on this blood, our offering...
86:36 - 86:40
Get sacrificed!
I don't subscribe to your religion!
86:40 - 86:44
- There he is!
- It just came off!
86:44 - 86:46
(Yells) Quickly! After them!
86:46 - 86:48
86:48 - 86:52
- It came off! I just showed courage.
- How many fingers you got left?
86:52 - 86:55
- You're all red again.
- I'm beginning to like it.
86:55 - 86:59
Ah... So! Ha!
86:59 - 87:01
He who wears the ring...

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right, just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teacher's chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Now, junior, behave yourself
Buy every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he gets (oh) is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling to spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Gonna tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Shoot the canary and you fed it to the neighbor's cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat
Well, in mama's head it's got to stop
We all miss you; You miss them?
The Beatles miss you; all the Beatles missed you
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before
It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah
I think about you night and day
I need you and it's true
When I think about you, I can say
I'm never, never, never, never blue
So I'm telling you, my friend
That I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Well, there's gonna be a time
When I'm gonna change your mind (When I'm gonna make you mine)
So you might as well resign yourself to me, oh yeah
Woah yeah
Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
Woke up last night, half past four
Fifty women knocking on my door
Went out last night, I didn't stay late
Before I got home I had nineteen dates
Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me
If you want someone
To make you feel so fine
Then we'll have some fun
When you're mine, all mine
So come, come on, come on
When you're by my side
You're the only one
Don't you run and hide
Just come on, come on
Yeah come on, come on, come on
Baby take a chance with me (Oh yeah)
Ah, Kansas City
Going to get my baby back home
Yeah, yeah
I'm going to Kansas City
Well, it's a long, long, time
Since my baby's been gone
Going to to get my baby one time
Going to get my baby one time
It's just a one, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, wah
Hey, baby, woo no clown
I say you're no clown
Now, now, now, now
Tell me baby
What's been wrong with you
Hey, now, baby, woo no clown
Well, I'll say bye
Bye, bye, baby bye, bye
Oh, so long
Bye, bye, baby I'm gone
Yeah, I said
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Woo, so long
Bye, bye, baby, I'm gone
On the road to Rishikesh
I was dreaming more or less
And the dream I had was true
Yes, the dream I had was true
I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just child of nature
I'm one of nature's children
Sunlight shining in your eyes
As I face the desert skies
And my thoughts return to home
Yes, my thoughts return to home
I'm one nature's children
Underneath the mountain ranges
Where the wind that never changes
Touch the windows of my soul
I call your name but you're not there
Was I to blame for being unfair
Oh I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone
I never weep at night
I can't go on
Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not going to make it
I'm not that kind of man
But just the same
I call your name
Woo, I call your name

I said I'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sittin' here wonderin'
I ain't got no matches but I sure
Got a long way to go
I'm an ole poor boy, and I'm a
Long way from home
I've never been happy cause everything I
Ever did was wrong
Well, if you don't want my peaches, honey
Please don't shake my tree
If you don't want any of those peaches honey
Please don't mess around my tree
I got news for you baby
Leave me here in misery
{Bridge}
Well, let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
Let me be your little dog
And when your big dog gets here
Watch how your puppy dog runs
Well, I said I'm sittin' here watchin'
Well, come on pretty baby, won't you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, won't you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance
Try to save our romance!
Slow down, baby, now you're moving way too fast
You gotta gimme little lovin', gimme little loving
Ow! If you want our love to last
Well, I used to walk you home, baby, after school
Carry your books home, too
But now you got a boyfriend down the street
Baby what you're trying to do?
You better slow down!
Baby, now you're moving way too fast
Brrr! If you want our love to last
Well, you know that I love you, tell the world I do

Slow down!

Coming to get my baby back home

Hey, baby, you're no clown
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
Not guilty
For getting in your way, while you try to steal the day
I'm not nodding for the rest, I'm not trying to steal your vest
I am not trying to be smart I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry for your aging head, but like you heard me said
Though you signing me a writ, while I'm trying to do my bit
I don't expect to take your heart I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you're underfed, but like you heard me said
For looking like a freak, making friends with every Sikh
For leading you astray on the road to Mandalay
I won't upset the apple cart I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you've been mislead, but like you heard me said
Sie liebt dich, yeh, yeh, yeh
Sie liebt dich, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeah
Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich
Gestern had ich sie gesehen
Sie denkt ja nur an dich
Und du solltest zu ihr gehen
Oh, ja sie liebt dich
Schoner kann es garnicht sein
Ja, sie liebt dich
Und da solltest du dich freuen
Du hast ihr weh getan
Sie wusste nicht warum
Du warst nicht schuld daran
Und drehtest dich nicht um
Und da solltest du dich freuen, woo
Denn mit dir allein
Kann sie nur glucklich sein
Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen
Entschuldige dich bei ihr
Ja das wird sie verstehen
Und dann verzeit sie dir
Und da solltest du dich freuen, ooh
Yeh, yeh, yeh
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeah

The shop window
Why why, says the sign
In the yard
Buy buy, says the sign
In the shop window
Why why, says the junk
Oh, oh, you've been good to me
You made me glad
When I was blue
And eternally I'll always be
In love with you
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl
I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love
I know little girl
Only a fool would doubt our love
Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do (Way that you do)
That's the kind of love
That is too good to be true
Well I'm the sheik of Araby
Your love belongs to me
Well at night where you're asleep
Into your tent I'll creep
(Not 'alf!)
The stars that shine above
Will light our way to love
Ah you rule this world with me
I'm the sheik of Araby
The sun that shines above
You rule this world with me
Well I'm the sheik of Araby, yeah
(The sheik of Araby)
She looks as an African Queen
She eating twelve 
chapattis
 and cream
She tastes as Mongolian lamb
She coming from out of Bahran
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
She like to be married with Yetti
He grooving such cookie spaghetti
She jumping as Mexican bean
To make that her body morphine
She catch Patagonian pancake
With that one and gin party makes
She having always good contact
She making with Apple and contract
[Chorus
What a shame what what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame what a shame what a shame
Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame what a shame
What a shame Mary Jane Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame
Let's hear it
Before we get taken away-
Standing in the garden waiting for the sun to shine
Hand me my umbrella when she says she wish she was mine
Everybody does think a thing it didn't come
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Standing in the garden waiting for the English sun to come and make me brown so I can be someone
Looking at the bench of next door neighbors
Crying to my mom of diamond tooth sabers
Everybody's got to have something hard to hold
Well instead of watching rainbows under the sun
You gotta get out son and make you one
Because you're not gonna make it if you cry cry cry I know
Shoot big
Whatever you do you gotta kill somebody to get what you wanna get
You gotta shoot big
Until you shoot big
I can't stand it
 Next number was called "Sha La La La La La"
 You're joking!
 No?
 La?
 Ah, but, in fact, "Baby It's You"
 Why don't you do it in your famous James Mason impersonation voice?
 Ha, ha
 All right! Go on, man! Do it in your
 I thought this next number was called one "Sha La La La La La," but, in fact, "Baby It's You"
 Get off! Get off!
 Ha, ha! Very good!
 Okay
 Can you do Mickey Mouse?
 Yes
 All ring, sing a song, fellows
 Okay, let's go!
My Bonnie lies over the ocean
My Bonnie lies over the sea
Oh bring back my Bonnie to me
Well my Bonnie lies over the ocean
Yeah bring back my Bonnie to me
Yeah bring back, ah bring back
Oh bring back my Bonnie to me to me
Oh bring back, oh bring back
Yeah my Bonnie lies over the ocean
Oh I said bring back my Bonnie to me
Oh bring back, ah bring back
If you ever leave me, I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you
The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely
If they knew that I lost my one and only
They'd be sad if you're bad to me
The leaves on the trees would be softly sighing
If they heard from the breeze that you left me crying
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me
But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me
So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Cos they know I got my one and only
They'll be glad you're not bad to me
They'll be glad you're not bad to me, to me, to me
We were talking
About the space between us all
And the people
Who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then it's far too late
When they pass away
About the love we all could share
When we find it
To try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world
If they only knew
Try to realize it's all within yourself
Enihsnus
Enihsnus ho
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me
So darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand by, oh stand, stand by me
If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
Whenever you're in trouble would you stand by me?
Oh, stand by
Step inside love and stay
Step inside love
I want you to stay
You look tired, love
Let me turn down the light
Come in out of the cold
Rest your head on my shoulder
And kiss me goodnight
We are together
Now and forever, come my way
(Joe Prairies and the Prairie Wallflowers
Los Paranoias
Ha ha!)
Invites you to (I can't take it!)
To just enjoy us (I can't take it!)
Come on you can (I can't take it!) do it
Baby, come on and join the Los Paranoias
Just enjoy us
Oh! Los Paranoias!
Come on and join us
Harmony
We're the Los Paranoias
We're here to sing for you
And what if you want us to
We will sing a little song for you
You never wear a stitch of lace
Your powder's never on your face
You're always wearing jeans except on Sunday
So please don't ever change
Now don't you ever change
I kind of like you just the way you are
You don't know the latest dance
But when it's time to make romance
Your kisses let me know you're not a tom-boy
Just promise me you're always going to to be
As sweet as you are
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're blue
I love you when you're mad at me
So how can I get tired of you
A lots of other girls I've seen
They know how to treat guys mean
But you would rather die than ever hurt me
Please don't ever change
Don't you ever change
Don't you ever change (fade out)

00:05:11	Come on!
00:05:12	Richard B. Starkey and his Aunt Jessica are always arguing about one thing or another.
00:05:18	Oh, I'm going!
00:05:21	Oh, go! Go on!
00:05:22	And what with today being Sunday and the weather looking up, you'd think they'd have given it a rest.
00:05:27	For goodness' sake, stop sitting down!
00:05:30	All right, all right, what's your hurry?
00:05:32	But no -- on and on they go.
00:05:36	"Good morning," said Richard.
00:05:38	"Good afternoon, sir," said the courier.
00:05:41	They were late.
00:05:41	JESSICA: 'Allo, Flo, you all right, girl?
00:05:42	I'll sit 'ere.
00:05:45	RICHARD: Yes, I'll have the window seat.
00:05:46	JESSICA: All right, so you'll have the window seat!
00:05:52	Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.
00:05:55	Welcome to Magical Mystery Tours!
00:06:00	I am your courier, Jolly Jimmy Johnson!
00:06:03	All my friends call me Jolly Jimmy -- and you are all my friends!
00:06:07	Over here is your hostess -- that lovely, delightful, delectable... Wendy Winters!
00:06:12	Lovely girl, lovely!
00:06:13	And over here, our driver for the trip, that wonderful driver, we hope...
00:06:18	Ha ha ha!
00:06:19	Alf! Off you go, Alf!
00:06:21	Here we go now. Splendid!
00:06:22	Fasten your safety belts, please.
00:06:25	Away-way-way we go!
00:06:28	Away we go, Alf, splendid!
00:06:31	Very comfy in the back there, is it? Lovely.
00:06:33	I say it's lovely. Get your popcorn out!
00:06:37	Ha ha!
00:06:38	Right hand down. There we are, splendid.
00:06:41	And away we go.
00:06:42	Anyway, I'll tell you something, you ain't coming away with me anymore.
00:06:46	Who bought the tickets for this trip? I did!
00:06:48	Yeah, with my money. I gave you the money.
00:06:50	I'm taking you out. You're not taking me anywhere.
00:06:52	I gave you the money, darling. Remember that.
00:06:55	And you've done nothing but eye all the fellas on the coach since we got here.
00:06:59	Shut your cakehole!
00:06:59	I dunno, since Uncle Jack died, you've never been the same.
00:07:03	Of course, 'cause I ain't got Uncle Jack, have I?
00:07:06	I remember him. I remember him.
00:07:07	If I ain't got him, I've got to get somebody else.
00:07:10	You should know, you're old enough at 21!
00:07:13	You should do a bit of knitting, do you good.
00:07:15	Who for? You?
00:07:17	Should I knit for you?
00:07:19	No, don't knit for me.
00:07:23	 Who is that man?
00:07:31	Oh, that's Mr Bloodvessel.
00:07:33	He's quite harmless. He comes on all the trips.
00:07:36	He thinks he's a courier.
00:07:38	Last trip, he thought he was the driver.
00:07:42	PAUL: Well, you know, when I saw your first film, I really thought you had something, but it was -- WOMAN: I was only about 6, then.
00:07:50	PAUL: Wasn't it "Blue Lady"? "Lady in Blue"?
00:07:53	Something like that.
00:07:55	WOMAN: How old are you?
00:07:56	PAUL: I myself am 30...
00:07:57	but I look a little younger due to the Fair Isle sweater.
00:08:01	Excuse me, sir.
00:08:02	I'd like to take a photograph of the young lady, do you mind?
00:08:05	I don't mind if Miss Gabriella doesn't.
00:08:08	Well, Miss Gabriella doesn't mind.
00:08:10	Thank you, bye-bye.
00:08:12	See you later, maybe.
00:08:13	Or we won't see him later. Can I have you out there?

00:11:44	Thank you.
00:12:12	As the bus leaves the town behind and heads for the country, everything begins to change.
00:12:20	Well, almost everything.
00:12:31	And already the magic is beginning to work.
00:12:42	  Ha ha!
00:13:05	Jolly good!

00:18:59	Aaaaah!
00:19:30	   If you look to your left, ladies and gentlemen, the view is not very inspiring.

00:30:44	Come with me now into that secret place where the eyes of man have never set foot.
00:31:07	Where's the bus?
00:31:18	Where's the bus?
00:31:21	Shh!
00:31:29	Where's the bus?
00:31:32	It's coming.
00:31:36	Where's the bus?!
00:31:39	The bus?
00:31:45	The bus is ten miles north on the Dewsbury road.
00:31:49	Oh!
00:31:50	It's only ten miles away.
00:31:53	Bus... ten miles!
00:31:55	Soon be here.
00:31:57	 The bus, 10 miles away...
00:32:02	Oh, ladies and gentlemen, quickly, look to your left!
00:32:04	Now there you see the ancient Roman ruins.
00:32:08	Now they really have been there an awful long time.
00:32:11	They are, in fact, a little difficult to see because they're almost flattened to the ground...
00:32:16	Meanwhile, back on the bus, things are happening -- and life lobbles on.
00:32:22	Indeed, the magic is so powerful that even Mr Bloodvessel emerges from his shell.
00:32:28	He turns to speak.
00:32:29	If I may take the liberty, Mister...
00:32:32	Be my guest.

Well the stars, always shine
You'll be mine, and I know
You'll be mine
How they shine
As the stars (as the stars)
Always shine (always shine)
You'll be mine (you'll be mine)
And the stars (and the stars)
Now, ah, ah, ah, ah...
(My darling
When you brought me that toast the other morning
I, I looked into you eyes
And I could see that National Health eyeball
And I loved you, like I've never done
Like I've never done before!)
Well the stars (well the stars)
They shine (oh, they shine)

Oh, you will be mine
At the star (at the star)
Always shining
One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
I'm hopin' every day
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"
Can't you see when I'm holding you near
All the things I do
Show my love, and I'm making it clear
Can't you see I've loved you from the start?
Don't you love me too?
I love you, but you're breaking my heart
If you only knew
If you say that you're gonna be mine
All the world would look so fine
If you'll be mine tonight
I'm hoping every day
How do you do what you do to me?
I wish I knew
If I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you
I'm feeling blue
Wish I knew how you do it to me
But I haven't a clue
You give me a feeling in my heart (ooh-la-la)
Like an arrow piercing through it
I suppose that you think you're very smart
But won't you tell me how do you do it?
You give me a feeling in my heart, ooh-la-la
Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me
Starlight and dewdrops are awaiting thee
Sounds of the rude world heard in the day
Led by the moonlight have all passed away
Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song
List while I woo the with soft melody
Gone are the cares of life's busy throng
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me!
Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea
Mermaids are chaunting the wild lorelei
Over the streamlet vapors are borne
Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn
Beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart
E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea
Then will all clouds of sorrow depart
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
If your life's not right, doesn't satisfy you
Don't get the breaks like some of us do
Better work it out, find where you've gone wrong
Better do it soon, you don't have long
Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there
If you want the most from everything you do
In the shortest time your dreams come true
In no time at all it makes you more aware
Very simple process takes you there
Do-do-doo
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Looking for release from limitation
There's nothing much without illumination
Can fool around with every different cult
There's only one way really brings results
Well come on Suzy Parker, everybody's welcome to come
(Come on, Suzy Parker, come on Suzy Parker)
Said come on Suzy Parker, everybody's welcome to come
(Come on Suzy Parker, come on Suzy Parker)
When you get on Suzy Parker everybody gets well done
I said come on Suzy Parker, everybody's welcome to come
Yeah you come to Suzy Parker, everybody gets well done
Go Suzy Go! (rattatatatatatatatatata...)
Yeah come on Suzy Parker, everybody's welcome to come
I said come on Suzy Parker everybody's welcome to come
When you get to Suzy Parker, everybody gets well done
Said go little Suzy (rattatatatatatatatata...)
Go little Suzy everybody gets well done
 Is that it? Is that the end?
 Yeah, yeah, that's it
 Fade, fade!
 Good track Oh, well, we'll stop there, stop there, stop there
 What an end!
 Quiet! All right, George
 Fade!
 Hold it!
 Oh, thank you
 Fade, you silly
 Well, we did We did that Oh, no! No! We've done that bit!
 The train comes in now
 We did that
 Yeah
 To prove we weren't playing the record, then, you see 'Cause, otherwise, there's no point in you being here, is there? Ha, ha, ha!
 Yeah, we did that, 'cause it sounds just like it, don't it?
 Pretty cool lot of fellows, aren't you? Here, Ringo, have a banana, catch!
Wake up in the morning I don't feel blue
?Cause I know I got you
Get a funny feeling all day and night
I get the funny feeling you don't treat me right
Should have read your letters
And then I'd know
I would have felt much better
Because I know you love me so
Let me tell you about a girl I know
She's my baby, and I love her so
And every morning when the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I love her so
When I call her on the telephone
She says, "Baby, I'm all alone"
Before the time I count from one to four
She'll be knocking on my door
Every evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and then she holds me tight
"Hey baby, everything's alright"
Hallelujah, I just love that chick so
(Instrumental)
All you need to do is say this little word
I know it sounds absurd but it's true
The magic in the mantra will give you the answer
And swallow this that's all you gotta do
Everything you need is here
And everything that's not here is not there
And if if there's something missing in this God almighty plan
Could it be you need a woman?
Just swallow this that's all you gotta do
But everything that's not here is not there
And if there's something missing in this God almighty plan
Well all you need to do is say this little word
Take three times a day after every meal
If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me (Oh oh)
You're quite contend to be bad
With all the advantage you had over me
Just because you're trouble
Then don't bring your troubles to me
I don't think it's funny
When you ask for money and things
Especially when you're standing there
Wearing diamond and rings (Oh oh)
You think I'm soft in the head
Well try someone softer instead anything
It's not so funny
When you know what money can bring
You better leave me alone
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two
(Ah rock on, anybody)
Three cool cats
Are coming up in a beat up car
Spitting up a lift of candy bar
Talking on about how sharp they are
Three cool chicks
Are walking down the street
Swinging their hips
Splitting up a bag of potato chips
I think cool cats really did flip
Yeah three cool chicks
Well up came that first cool cat
He said, "Man look at that
Man, do you see what I see?"
"Well I want that middle chick"
"I want that little chick"
"Hey man save one chick for me"
Hey, well three cool chicks
Well they love like angels from up above
And three cool cats really fell in love
But three cool chicks
Made three fools out of three cool cats
(Three cool cats, oh three cool cats)
 Hoo!
Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen (Hoo!)
As the slow ray round about
Deep and crisp and crispy
Brightly show the boot last night
On the mosty cruel
Henry Hall and David Lloyd
Betty Grable too
 Hello, this is John, speaking with his voice. (Huh!) We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already, but we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us. It all happened really when Please Please Me became a number one hit, and after that, well cor' the blimeys, heave the mo'! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show
 (whistling)
 This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because "Love Me Do" got into the top twenty, and we can't believe really that so many things have happened in between already! Just before I pass you over to Paul, (Arf-arf! Arf-arf!) I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everyone who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October. (Huh!) I'd like to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens. In the meantime:
Garry Crimble to you
Garry Mimble to you
Getty Bable, dear Christmas
Happy Birthday me too
 This is Paul here. Everything that John said goes for me too, 'specially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, 'cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha! Ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we'll try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like Jelly Babies. Well! We used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then, we've been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, we've gone right off Jelly Babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams and chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing
 Yes! Yes! Oh yes!
 Well, lots of people asked us what we enjoy best, you see, concerts and television or recording? We like doing stage shows 'cause it's, you know, it's great to hear an audience enjoying themselves. But the thing we like best, I think so anyway, is going into the recording studio...
 Yes, we enjoy that very kindly!
 ...to make new records, which is what we've been doing all day before we started on this special message. Well, eh, what we like to hear most is one of our songs, you know, taking shape in a recording studio, ah, one of the ones what John and I have written, and then listening to the tapes afterwards to hear how it all worked out, you see. Well, I'm running over my time, and people are telling me to stop and Ringo...
 Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop shouting, those animals!
 ...so I'll finish off now with it wishing everyone Happy Crimble and a Merry New Year and especially all the ones who paid the subscription
 Ja, das wird uns danke schon
Und denn gruss von even
Ja, denn gruss von even schon

Ja, Ringo!
Hello, Ringo here
As you know I was the last member to join The Beatles. I started to play drums in the group 1962, ha-ha-ha! Have been in a couple of other groups...
(Oh, just wish the people a merry, happy, go on, for Christmas, Christmas)
Merry, Happy New Year, and folks, Happy Christmas and may, may everything you wish be granted
(Sing, sing us Wenceslas, King Wenceslas)
King Wenceslas:
Well, good King Wenceslas looked out (Oh ho!)
On the feast of Stephen (Hey!)
When the snow was on the ground (Yeah!)
Deep and crisp and even (Oh yeah!)
Hooray!
Thank you, Ringo! Thank you, Ringo! We'll phone you! (Ha ha ha!)
I'm George Harrison. Nobody else has said anything yet about our fan club secretaries, Ann Collingham and Bettina Rose, not to mention Freda Kelly in Liverpool. (Good old Freda!) So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great, big thank you to Ann, Bettina and Freda for all the hard work they've done, and we just hope you can go on pleasing you for a long time, 'cause it's gonna, 'cause it to your reaction are to our records that really matters
And I'd just like to say:
Brightly was the shone that night
Though the winter cruel
When a pork pie came inside
Gathering winter cruel
Rudolph, the red nosed reindeer (Ho!)
Had a very shiny nose (A shiny nose!)
When ev'rybody picked it...
Ha, ha, ha, ha...
Oh yeah! Oh!
Rudolph, the red nosed Ringo (Rudolph!)
Had a very shiny nose
Merry Christmas everybody!
The sun is fading away
That's the end of the day
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way
Just one kiss and I'll go
Don't hide the tears that don't show
To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way will I go
They were right I was wrong
True love didn't last long
I'll be on my way hey
Drive My Car
She said "Baby, can't you see?
I wanna be famous, a star of the screen
But you can do something in between"
Beep beep-m beep beep, yeah
What You're Doing
Look, what you're doing
I'm feeling blue and lonely
You got me running and there's no fun in it
The Word
It's so fine, it's sunshine
As I was slowly passing
An orphan's home one day
I stopped for just a little while
To watch the children play
Alone a boy was standing
And when I asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see
And he began to cry
I'm nobody's child
Just like the flowers
I'm growing wild
I got no mummy's kisses
I got no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me
No mummy's arms to hold me
Or sue me when I cry
'cos sometimes I feel so lonesome
I wish that I could die
I'll walk the streets of heaven
Where all blinds can see
And just like for the other kids
It will be a home for me
I, I saw a girl in my dreams
And so it seems that I will love her
Oh you, you are that girl in my dreams
And so it seems that I will love you
And I waited for your kiss
Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do
Oh I'll be there, yeah
Waiting for you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you came just one dream ago
And now I know that I will love you
Oh I knew when you first said hello
That's how I know that I will love you
Every night I can't sleep thinking of you
And every little thing that you do
And I'm telling all my friends I'm in love
And I'm telling the world you make me feel proud
You make me want to shout out aloud
So I'm telling all my friends I'm in love
Oh, I'm feeling on the top of the world
I'm in love with a wonderful girl
I've never felt this way before
If this is love, give me more, more, more, more
...I'm telling you
...thing that you do
I'm telling all my friends I'm in love, in love
Yes, I'm telling all my friends I'm in love, in love
I'm telling all my friends I'm in love
Some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken away my sweet desire, oh now
Some other guy now, I just don't want to hold my hand, oh now
I'm the lonely one, as lonely as I can feel all right
Some other guy now, is sipping up the honey like a yellow dog, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken my love just like I'm gone, oh now
Oh oh hoho
Oh yeah! Ow! Ow!
Some other guy, is making me very very mad, oh now
Some other guy now, is making my past seem oh so bad, oh now
Some other guy now, she was the first girl I ever had, oh now
I'm a-talking to you, right now
Hey! Yeah!
Tonight, Enoch Powell said, “Get out immigrants
Immigrants a-better go home”
Hah, hah, hah, hah
Tonight, (Harold?) Wilson said to the immigrants
“You better get back to your Commonwealth homes”
He said, “Ya better get back home”
Now, Enoch Powell
He said to the folks
He said (unclear) the color of your skin
He said he don’t care what it’s
(unintelligible)
So, Ted Heath said to Enoch Powell
He said “You better get out
Or else (you’re going to) trial”
(Yes?) Enoch Powell
Enoch, you better go home”
So, Wilson said to (?)
“Come on boy
We gotta swing
We gotta go back to the (unclear) hill
And (unintelligible)”
So, Enoch Powell said to Wilson, Heath
“(Boy, you Commonwealth?)”
Commonwealth (Yes?!)
If you don’t want trouble
Then you better go back to home
(So?), I went to Pakistani
I went to India
I been to ol’ Calcutta
And I’ve had enough of that
I’m coming back (yes?!)
To England town (Yes, welcome!)
And dirty Enoch Powell
And he’s had enough of Parliament
Oh, Commonwealth (Yes?!)
Can you hear me?
Well, there ain’t (unintelligible) Enoch Powell (unintelligible) (Oh!)
Well, I (chucked/chugged?) up to Australia
I (seen?) to New Zealand
You better come live with us
We’re gonna have some fun
We’re going up to India
We’re going to Pakistan
We’re going up to Europe and (unintelligible)
(Unintelligible) Enoch Powell (unintelligible)
He says you gotta (unintelligible)
Yeah, Commonwealth (Yes?!)
Oh, hear me talking
Commonwealth
Yeah, that Commonwealth
But it’s much too wealthy for me (too common for me)
Much too common for me
I (unclear) to Australia and New Zealand, too
(Unclear) to Pakistan and India, too
I came back to West Indies
And I had a cricket match
I went to (Tuscon?), Africa
(Unintelligible)
Oh, Commonwealth
Well, you’re much too common for me
Everybody (say it/sing it)
(Uh?) Commonwealth (Yes?!)
Enoch Powell, Commonwealth (Yes!)
Immigrants, Commonwealth (Yes!)
Well, I would join the common market
But it’s much too common for me (Yes!)
I'd say some day
I'm bound to give my heart away
When I do
It's for you love, true love
Seems to be all I'm thinking of
But it's true
It's for you
They said that love was a lie
Told me that I
Never should try to find
Somebody who'd be kind
Kind to only me
So I just tell them they're right
Who wants a fight
Tell them I quite agree
Nobody'd love me
Then I look at you
And love comes love shows
I give my heart and no one knows
That I do
(All): (Singing)
Ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
Ev'rywhere it's song.
London, Paris, Rome and New York,
Tokyo, Hong Kong.
Oh, ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
And I'm off to join the cheer!
At the end of ev'ry year!
I said that ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
One more time now!
Ev'rywhere it's Christmas....
Orowainya, orowainya, orowainya, ooh,
Endomainya, endomainya, endomainya, ooh.
(G): Our story opens in Corsica. On the verandah is a bearded man in glasses conducting a small choir.
Orowainya, orowainya, orowainya....
Yohoo! Yodellaihetee! Yohoo!
(R): Meanwhile, high in the Swiss Alps, two elderly Scotchmen munch on a rare cheese.
(G): Wonderful stuff this, Agnes.
(J): Aye, it's wonderful stuff.
Hodellaihetee! Yodellaihetee!
(R): I'm standing in the entrance to the main tent. Immediately behind me, the festivities have already begun.
(J): Tell me, are you enjoying the wine?
(P): I am indeed your Highness. It goes well with me. (*Yeh, very good very good, ha ha ha!?)
(P): The King seems to be enjoying himself tonight! (*You might not have seen him in such good focus since the October festival.?)
(J): (*Alright!?) Is there a doctor here? Is there a doctor around here? Did anybody see one?
(G): At the same time as this, in the captain's mess on board the H.M.S. Tremendous, a toast is being proposed.
(P): To her majesty!
(All): To her majesty!
(*Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho!?)
(P): Podgy the bear and Jasper were huddled around the unlit fire in the centre of the room. "There are no more matches left, Podgy," said Jasper. "Then buy some, Jasper, old friend," said Podgy. "Make a list and afterwards we'll go to the shop and buy matches and (*buy?) candles and buns." "There's no more paper to write on, Podgy" "No need to worry, Jasper. You keep saying to yourself 'matches' and I'll keep saying 'candles' until we reach the shop. Then we won't need to write it down. We'll remember." "Who'll remember the buns, Podgy?" "We both will, Jasper ... Matches," "Candles." "Matches." "Candles." "Matches." "Candles." "Matches." "Candles." "Matches." "Candles."
(J): In the long dark corridors of Felpin Mansions, a door slams and the shadowy figure of Count Balder appears. The Count is the eccentric son of Baron Lndsberg, the inventor of the rack. He speaks "Guten Tagen, meinen damen and herren. Welcome to Felpin Mansions. The butler will show you to your rooms. Butler!" "Yes, sir!" "Show the ladies and gentlemen to their rooms."
(P): Come in.
(J): May I come in?
(P): Come, come in, Count!
(J): May I?
(P): Oh, yes, come in.
(J): Ah, thank you. I was wondering if you knew any of the songs from the good 'ol days.
(P): Oh, my goodness, yes. Don't you worry on that score. I hear the Baron likes, uh, I hear the Baron likes the good old tunes.
(J): Yes, I do.
(P): So do I, Count, so do I. But they're all melodies, aren't they?
(P): No, don't worry. I'll play this one. Do you like this one? Listen to this one.
(P): (Singing)
Please don't bring your banjo bag,
I know where it's been.
I wasn't hardly gone a day
When it became the scene.
Banjos, banjos all the time,
I can't forget that tune.
And if I ever see another banjo,
I'm going out to buy a big balloon,
I'm going out to buy a toy balloon,
And if I ever see another bloom,
(P): Yes, everywhere it's Christmas.
And i'm off to join the cheer!
At the end of ev'ry year,
(P): (*Ha-ha-ha?) Jolly good, (*ho-ho?) jolly good.
You know you make me want to
Shout!
Click my finger!
Throw my hands back!
Kick my heels up!
Come on now!
Take it easy!
A little bit softer now
A little bit louder now
Hey hey hey hey!
Jump up and shout now!
Everybody shout now!
Everybody jump up now!
Shout! Shout! Shout! Shout!
I never knew that a day like today lay before us
I've got the sun in my heart and my heart's in the sun
The skys are as bright as your eyes the horizon is open
Love is the ceiling feeling are reeling free as the air
Forever on and forever
Forever on side by side
Whoever knew that we too could be free as we fancied
Fancy is free but are we who are bound to each other by love
To each other by love
Fancy is free but we are who are bound to each other by love
 This is a Dorsey Burnette number, brother of Johnny Burnette, called "Lonesome Tears in My Eyes," recorded on their very first LP in 1822!  Ha!

This is the story
About a boy named Ted
If his mother said (Said)
"Ted, be good (Be good, Ted)," he would (Alright)
She told him tales
About his soldier dad
But it made her sad
Then she cried, oh my
Ted used to tell her
He'd be twice as good
And he knew he could
Because in his head he said
"Mummy don't worry
Your mblmblmbl's here
Taking good care of you
Mama don't worry
Your Teddy boy's here
Teddy's going to see you through"
And she said
"Teddy don't worry
Your mummy's here
Taking good care of you"
She said, "Teddy don't worry
He said, "Ta da da"
Then came the day
She found herself a man
Teddy turned and ran
Oh far away, oh yeah
He couldn't stand
Just to be around
So he left the town far away, yeah yeah
Take your partners
And do-si-do
Hold them tight
And don't let go
When got it. Jump up
When you got it
Then let it go
Hold them tight then
Now Ted used to tell her
Because in his head, he said
Well, I got a woman way cross town

She says she loves me just for me, yeah
You know she loves me so tenderly
She's there to love me
All day and night
Never grumbles or fusses

But the way that you hurt me
I just don't understand
Well you say that you need me
Like an ocean needs sand
But the way you deceive me
Well you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a one-sided love
When I see you, I just don't know what to say
I like to be with you every hour of the day
So if you want me just like I need you
You know what to do
I watched you walking by, and you looked alone
I hope that you won't mind if I walk you back home
And if you want me just like I need you
Just call on me when you're lonely
I'll keep my love for you only

Take out some insurance on me, baby
Well, if you ever, ever say goodbye

Well, if your hands start a-clapping
And your fingers start a-popping
And your feet start a-moving around
And if you start to swing and sway
When the band starts to play
A real cool way out sound
And if you get to can't help it
And you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move a round
You get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure
Get a pair of dancing shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're going to have a lot of pleasure?
Don't you worry about a thing if you start to dance and sing
And chills coming up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too
Well, here's something for you to do
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
You better leave my kitten all alone
But I told you big fat bulldog
You better leave her alone
This dog is going to get you
If you don't leave her alone
Well, Mister Dog, I'm going to hit you
On the top of your head
That child is going to miss you
You're going to wish that you were dead
If you don't leave my kitten all alone
Well I told you big fat bulldog
Hey, hey, hey

We were sailing along (Twist and shout)
On Moonlight Bay (Ooh)
We could hear the voices singing (I like it!)
They seemed to say (Keep on, Bongo)
You have broken my heart (Oh, twist and shout)
So go away
(Are the Beatles gone?
No, they're here
Oh)
With you big, far, hairy legs
On Moonlight Bay
Ooohhh
Ha ha!
(Cool man. What? Can we do 'Blue Moon Of Kentucky?'
What?)
Well blue moon
(No?
Yeah, it's got the chords that was opening
Here right!)
(Just a short version.)
Blue moon, blue moon
Keep on shining bright
Blue moon, keep on shining bright
My baby back tonight
I said blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well blue moon of Kentucky
Just keep on shining
Well, it was on one moonlight night
With the stars shining bright
Wish blown high
Love said goodbye
Blue moon of Kentucky
(Ha ha ha!)
Why why can't we love again?
Why why are you shy on love?
If you only knew how much I love you
Why can't you love me again?
Why why don't you open your heart?
Why why are we so far apart?
I just want your loving arms around me, yeah
I got to find a way to make you take me back
Baby won't you tell me
Why why why why are we so far apart?
Why can't you love me
Oh Carol, don't let him
Steal your heart away
Well I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day
Well come into my machine
So we can move on out
I know a jumping little joint
Where we can jump and shout
It's not too far back on the highway
Not too long a ride
Well you take your car along
And you park it outside
A little cutie takes your hat
And you can thank her, ma'am
Well every time you're going to drive
You find the joint is jammed
Well if you want to hear some music
Like the boys all play
Hold tight, tap your foot
Don't let it carry you away
Don't let the heat overcome you
Because they play so loud
While the music will treat you
When they get a crowd
Well you can dance
I know you will, you thought
I got my eyes on you baby
Because you dance so good
Don't let him
I've got to learn to dance
If it takes you all night and day
In the night, there are sights to be seen
Stars like jewels on the crown of a Queen
But the only sight I wanna view
Is that wonderful picture of you
On a Streetcar, or in the café
All of the evening, and most of the day
My mind is in a maze what can I do?
I still see that picture of you
It was last summer, I fell in love
My heart told me what to do
I saw you there on the crest of a hill
An' I took a little picture of you
Then you were gone, like a dream in the night
With you went my heart, my love and my life
I didn't know your name, what could I do?
I only had a picture of you
With you, went my heart, my love and my life
I only had a picture of you, oh yeah
That wonderful picture of you
I'm left with a picture of, oh yeah
Two
One, two, three
Hey baby, won't you take a chance?
Say that you'll let me have this dance
Let's dance, come on, let's dance
Do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
Come on, come on, let's dance
Hey baby, woh, you thrill me so
Hold me tight, don't let me go
Hey hey, hey, come on, let's dance
Come on, hey, come on, let's twist, alright
Hey, baby, if you're all alone
Maybe you'll let me walk you home
Hey, hey, come on, let's dance
Come on, hey, come on, let's dance
Hey, baby, things are swinging right
Yes, I know that tonight's the night
Come on, hey, come on, let's dance, oh
Any old thing that you wanna do
Come on, oh come on, let's dance
Hey, let's dance, come on, let's dance
Come on, hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
Come on, oh yeah, oh yeah
It’s okay to leave a dog in a hot car
It’s okay to leave a dog in a hot car (hot car!)
Nothing bad could possibly happen
If you leave a dog in a hot car
I don't care if I spent my dough
Night going to be
Going to rock it up
Going to shake it up
Going to roll it up
Have them ball tonight
Rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you never done nothing
To save your doggone soul
Well get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said get out of that kitchen
I said to my soul:
You're the devil in a frying pan
Well I said shake rattle and roll
You can knock me down
Slap my face
Slander my name
All over the place
Do anything that you want to do
But oh oh honey
Lay off of them shoes
Now don't you step
On my blue suede shoes
Well you can do anything
But lay off of them blue suede shoes
Ah go!

But ah ah honey
Ah go, hit it, Carl!
Well blue blue
Blue suede shoes

But I'm glad all over
Yeah the goose pimples baby
Because I feel so good
When you call me like you do
Ooh mercy, I'm rock gone puppy
And I'm happy
And I'm glad all over
Your touch sewed me
Like an electric wire
Never thought of make love
It don't take much looking
To see what I've got
But it shows, yes it shows
Come on honey Bonnie
Give me one more time
Every time you do
Well I feel glad all over
Tried to tell you
How I'm cooking inside
When we're cheek to cheek
My temperature is low
Fever is high
I can't speak
I'm too weak
Well come on honey Bonnie
Hot dang gilly
Well, hot dang gilly

I go back to the top of the slide,
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again.

(J): Wonsaponatime, there were two balloons called
Jock and Yono. They were strictly in love, bound to happen
in a million years. They were together man. Unfortunatimetable, they seemed to have previous experience which
kept calling them one way oranother (you know howitis).
But they battled on against overwhelming oddities,
including some of there beast friends. Being in love,
they cloong together even more man. But some of the
poisonessmonsters of outrated buslodedapethrowers did
stick slightly, and they occasionally had to resort to
the dry cleaners. Luckily this did not kill them and
they weren't banned form the Olympic Games. They lived
hopefully ever after and who could blame them.
(G): Well, here we are again, another fab Christmas. Christmas
time is here again. Ain't been around since last year.
And we'd like to take this opportunity, all the way from
America, to say happy Christmas to you our faithful,
beloved fans all over the world who have made our life
worth living. And over here I have Mr. Malcolm Evans who
through thick and thin would surely like to say a word
of greeting at this festive occasion.
(M): Merry Christmas children everywhere!
(?): At the first stroke, it will be ...
(R): ... Ringo Starr. Thank you!
"Good evening."
"Hello me dear. I didn't know you were coming."
"I'm not surprised."
"Well, I am! Certainly am!"
"I would have thought so myself."
"Well, if you ask me, I think it's insane."
"Occasionally."
"Yes, me, too. Twice a week sometimes."
"Fourteen and six."
"Nineteen and five to save me if you don't mind."
"Yes, I know."
"Don't you say yes to me! I'm telling you!"
"This is a private line, you know."
"Private line? I've been on this line for two years."
(R): Well, it's my proud pleasure tonight to introduce one of
the most versatile performers in our career. And he's
come all the way from Stokely Carmichel's -on-Sea.
And I hope you're going to like him. Let's give him a
big hand ...
(P): (Double-Tracked Singing)
Happy Easter, happy autumn,
(J): Once upon a pool table there lived a short-haired
butcher's boy by the way of Ostergrad. It comes in
Sentencepoolararrowic Airport. Her father was in a
long story cut short in the middle of his life sentence.
We're indebted to the Colloquial office for its immediate
disposal of her honorwitz, including, I might add, hoc virtallo a totem. On the other handbag, I mean to say
l'amoure ne soome tu joure realistic, strictly speaking.
For this film is about an hourglass houseboat. The full
meaning of Winchester Cathedral defies description. Their
loss was our Gainsborough nil.
(J (Double Tracked)):
The sound of a manservantile defectively lasting barred
up in a love-dizzy gar-di-dell time. How close can you
Gettysburg and ever underly council ya originally a
birdbath feeling--
(G): Cut!
We have a special guest here this evening, Mr.
Tiny Tim. I'd like to ask him to say a few words.
(T): Oh, hello to you nice Beatles. Ah, it's so wonderful,
what a thrill it is talking here. Ah, in Mr. Harrison's
presence, Mr. Weiss' presence, and all his nice wonderful
friends. And the thing is, I just wanna say Merry
Christmas to you all. And, ah, a Happy New Year.
(G): Thank you, Tiny. Would you like to sing us a little song?
(T): Ah, I'd love to. Here's a song I did in 1966 in front of
Miss Jill for the first time. And I did this in Albert
Hall, and what a thrill it was, ah, to do this then, and
now ... exactly the way I did it then.
(Singing)
He's a, ooh, real nowhere man,
Living in his nowhere land,
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.
Hasn't got a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to,
Nowhere man, (yes?) Don't worry,
Take your time, don't hurry,
Nowhere man, the world's at your command, ooh.
He's a, huh huh, real nowhere man,
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody, ooh, ooh.
(G): Thank you, Tiny. Thank you and God bless you, Tiny.
(T): God bless you all. Oh, God bless you all.

The leaves of brown
Came tumbling down
Remember in September in the rain
The sun went out
Just like a light
To every word
Of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seems
To play a sweet refrain
Thought it's spring
To me it's still September
Oh that September in the rain
I said I said it's September in the rain
Ah September in the rain
I'm sure to fall, fall in love
I'm sure to fall in love with you
You are so sweet and so near
So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling don't ever let me go
Loving you is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life

This girl don't love me, but I love her just the same
Oh, oh, Ruby, Ruby, how I want ya
Like a ghost I'm gonna haunt ya
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, will you be mine sometime?
Well, each time I see you waving my heart cries
I'll tell ya, I'm gonna steal you away from all those guys
Oh, oh, from the happy day I met you
I made a bet that I was going to get you
Alright now
Hey
Oh, when this girl looks at me she just sets my heart aflame, oh
Oh, I got some love and money too
I'm gonna give them all to you
Now, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, will you be mine sometime?
Come on, Ruby, baby, now, hey
Hey come on, oh, come on
Shake it honey, oh
I said, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Ruby won't you be mine? Oh
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, baby
Oh, baby, come on
Shake it honey, alright
One, two, three, four!

It's the same old song
But a different meaning since...
(G): Copyright, Johnny!
(R): Copyright. Can't say that
(P): Hey, yeah! All right. What are we gonna do without a copyright, yeah?

(J)...for all the boys in B.A.O.R.E
(P): Yeah, alright

(J): Well, here in Munich, it's not quite as fine as it is in London
(R): Well, Kenneth, the weather's raining here, it's not very good
(J): Well it's not bad over here, but summer, you know, we had a bit of rain and all that
(R): Stay tuned in, it's a five-way link-up
(J): If you've enjoyed this program, tune to 29314567 megacycles. If you can't find that, drop it!
And never brought to mind? China!
Don in Vietnam and China...too...
And look at all those bodies Jordan
Floating in the River Jordan
(P): Well, that looks as though it's about it for the year
(R): Well, that should cover Israel
(P): We've certainly tried our best to, ah...
(R): Please everybody
(P): ... please everybody. If we haven't done what we could've done. We've tried
(J): And if you haven't got yours, send four pence in and get a free one!
(G): And seeing as (*since?) we're gathered around the Christmas microphone here in the studio, we might as well get together with a little Christmas message for you
(P): Which goes something like this...
(G): ... like this
Christmas comes but once a year
But when it does, you know it's here
Because we've got a hmm-mm-mm-aam-
Singing
But when it does it brings good cheer
Because we've got the hmm-mm-mm-aam -
For Christmas
Yesterday, doo-dah
Oh, i believe in Christmas day

Christmas day, Christmas day
(J): This year has turned out to be a big year for us
(P): (Singing) Christmas day
(J): One of our biggest years since we can remember
(J): And we can remember a lot of big years. Take...take bugs
(P): (Singing) Christmas day, Christmas day
(J): And especially those abroad and those of you in B.O.R. 2459783 (*245 BIG TIME 783?)
(J): 'Cause (*There's?) a lot of us here wanna wish a lot of you there - and the weather's perfectly alright, thank you. And, don't forget, the old, the new, some folks blue, some folks green. You take no notice of 'em. It's an all- white policy in the group
All my troubles seemed so far away, yeah, yeah
(Now it looks as though)
Oh, bless you all on Christmas day

(P): Turned it off, basher?
(All): (Singing) Jingle bells...
(P): Hello, everybody, this is Paul, and I'd just like to thank you all for buying our records during the past year. We know you've been buying 'em because the sales have been very good, you see. Don't know where we'd be without you, really though
(J): In the army, perhaps
(P): Oh, we hope you've enjoyed listening to the records as much as we've enjoyed melting them - No, no, no, that's worng. - making them. We're in No. 2 studio at the moment, at EMI, taping this little message for you
(J): Yes, we are
(P): We are indeed. I just thought I'd make that... This is the same studio we've used all along - since the old days of "Love Me Do" - many years ago it seems, doesn't it?
(J): Ah, those were the days ...
(P): Well, that's about all, I think. Except, to wish you all a Happy Christmas and a very New Year! Now I'll pass you over to John. John!
(J): John. John speakin'. Thanks all of you who bought me book. Thank you folks for buying it. It was very handy. And there's another one out pretty soon, it says here. Hope you buy that, too. It'll be the usual rubbish but it won't cost much. You see, that's the bargain we're going to strike up. I write them in my spare time, it says here. It's been a busy year...
(P): Did you write this yourself?
(J): No! It's somebody's bad handwroter. It's been a busy year Beatle peadles, one way and another. But it's been a great year, too. You fans have seen to that. Page 2. Thanks a lot folks and a hap-py, ah, Christmas and a merry goo-year. Crimble maybe. And I'll hand you to George who will speak to you - now!
(G): Thank you John. Thank you. Hi there! I'd like to thank all of you for going to see the film. 'spect a lot of you saw it more than once
(R): I did
(G): Did you? So did I. Thanks anyway. 'Cause it makes us very pleased, ya know. We had a quiet time making it. Actually, we didn't. We had a great time making it. And we're glad it turned out okay. The next one should be completely different. We start shooting it in February. This time it's gonna be in color
(J): Green
(G): It'll be a big laugh we hope. (Ha ha ha!) Well, we ... Big laugh, ha ha ha, yeah, it'll be a big laugh
(J): Be a big laugh, you imagine?
(G): And we may see all of you soon. Hope so anyway. All the best. And, happy New Year. And a Happy Christmas. And here's Ringo!
(R): Thanks, Geroge. Ringo here. Well, the others have thanked you for the discs and John's book and for everything - oh, no - for enjoying the film. I'd like to thank you just for being fans. It's been a funny year, you know. One minute we're in England, next, we're away. 'spect you're wondering where we've been. Well, Beatle people, we've been to Australia and America and New (*crash*) - who's dropping that? - New Zealand and Australia...
(P): And New Zealand
(R): Ha ha! Or is that New Zealand? So much travelling! But you've stayed loyal, haven't you? Anyway, those airport receptions knocked us out, man, great!
(J): Dig!
(R): Well, that's about it from me. I'd just like to say, all the best for Christmas and happy new year. That's about it

I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I've found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time
Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Because I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget
Well let me tell you well no chick made could be the same
As Sweet Georgia Brown
Crazy feet that dance so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown
Fella’s sigh, and even cry for Sweet Georgia Brown
I tell you just why you know I don’t lie
It’s been said, she knocks them dead in any old town
Since she came right it’s a shame how she brings them down
In Liverpool she even dare to criticize the Beatles’ hair
With their whole fan club standing there, I mean Sweet Georgia Brown
I say this group is absolutely marvelous with the piano
Don’t you think so?
Not too commercial boys, not too commercial!
When it comes to music Sweet Georgia known to mind
Don’t buy clothes at fashion shows but she still looks fine
Snap chicks cry, they want to die when Georgie does the twist
I never would try to tell you just why use your imagination
There's a DJ crazy for her living in out home town
Since she came like it’s a shame, she turns him down
Records that she can get are records, they ain't sent him yet
Carolina may have Dina, but that don’t have Georgia Brown
Oh such Sweet Georgia
Yeah yeah yeah I mean brown, oh oh oh
Sweet Georgia Brown
Way down upon the Swanee River
Far, far away
That's where my heart is yearning ever
Home where the old folks stay
Far, far away-hey
Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever
All up and down the whole creation
Sadly I roam
I'm a still a-longin' for the old plantation
Oh, for the old folks at home
Ah-oh-oh!
Oh, my my!
Well, way down upon the Swanee River
I'm still a-longin' for the old plantation
And for the old folks at home
All the world is sad and dreary
Ev'rywhere I roam
Oh, darkies, how my heart grows weary
Far from the old folks at home
Each time I look into your eyes
I see that there, there heaven lies
And as I look
I see the love of the loved
Someday they'll see that from the start
My place has been deep in your heart
And in your heart
Though I said it all before
I will say it more and more
Now that I'm really sure
You love me
And I know that from today
I'll see it in the way
That you look at me
And say ah you love me
So let it rain, I'll never care
Deep in your heart, I'll still be there
And when I'm there
So let it rain, I'll never I care
Deep in your heart, I'd still be there
Mama!

Blues and sorrow
And I love you tomorrow
Just suit you just fine
I can't forget that you told me
So many promising lies
How must I forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes?
You've broken my heart
Gonna do it again
And I can't forget
The spell that I'm in
Can't forget that you told me
I'm a-trying to forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes
I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
You treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby
I don't want you
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
You do me wrong now
My love is strong now
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tied up
I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend
Another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
I just can quit now
To complete the many songs needed for their double-LP, The Beatles recorded regularly during twenty weeks from 30th May to 16th October 1968. The final studio date was a 24-hour marathon session to create the running order for the four sides of the album and the edits and cross-fades between the songs. The sessions mark an important turning point in their recording career because it was during this period that The Beatles first recorded on an eight-track tape machine.
Since 1964, the group had used four-track for all their album albums by but 1966, they found their musical arrangements usually required more tracks than were available. The solution was the create extra ones by copying the first four tracks to a second blank tape and simultaneously mixing some of them together to leave free as many racks as were needed for addition overdubs. 'Bouncing Down' was a time consuming process because the tracks that were being mixed together would form part of the final sound balance of the completed song so it was important to be satisfied with the mix before overdubbing commenced. With eight tracks now available, the problem was eliminated - until even more were needed.
Work began on the album using four tracks and, while some songs could be confined to these, most had to be 'bounced down' to a second, third, or even - as with 'Revolution 1' and 'Ob-LA-Di, Ob-La-Da' - a fourth tape. The Beatles' first experience of using an eight track recording at Abbey Road was during a session on 3rd September for 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps'. As it had been started  on four-track. the master was transferred to an eight-track machine to allow further overdubbing.
However, 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' was re-recorded on eight-track from scratch two days later with a guest appearance by Eric Clapton. and completed on 6th September with several overdubs. George's decision to ask a friend to play on his song was a significant one. Although The Beatles had previously used other musicians on their sessions, they had been from other areas of music such as classical, jazz or Indian music. For the first time, here was a star musician performing on an instrument already featured in the group.
The album's long sessions would often begin in the afternoon and continue until daybreak the next morning. There were also occastions when two songs were recorded at the same time in separate studios. In July, engineer Geoff Emerick left the sessions and did not work with the group again until nearly a year later the 
Abbey Road
. Ken Scott, who has first sat at the mixing desk for some of the 
Magical Mystery Tour
 songs, recored and mixed two thirds of 'The White Album'. For one week, George Matin relinquished his seat in the room so that he could take a holiday and, consequently, his 21-year old production assistant Chris Thomas supervised sessions.
The group's ninth album in the UK was called simply 
The Beatles
 but quickly became better known as 'The White Album'. The double-LP was issued on the fifth anniversary of the release of their second album With The Beatles - 22nd November, 1968.
The Beatles released 34 new tracks in 1968 - returning to the high level of productivity they had maintained from 1963 to 1965. The first music of the year came in March with the arrival of their seventeenth single 'Lady Madonna'. Soon after it was recorded, the Beatles flew to Rishikesh, India for several weeks of mediation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and they enjoyed a prolific period of song writing at this remote location. They began recording these new songs at Abbey Road on 30th May and studio work occupied most of their time until the final session on 16th October. Two songs from this period were released as a single on 30th August, 1968 - 'Hey Jude' and 'Revolution'. It was the first Beatles record to be pressed with the Apple label and the Parlophone imprint was also replaced for the two LP discs comprising 
.
Any expectations of a cover to rival the vivid art work of Sgt. Pepper of Magical Mystery tour were immediately overturned. The outside of the sleeve was completely white was the only lettering consisting of 'The Beatles' embossed on the front and also printed on the spine with the catalogue number. Early copies also had an individual number stamped on the front. However, in contrast to the minimalistic look, some generous inserts were slipped alongside the records. There were four glossy color photographs of the individual Beatles and a large fold out poster displaying a photo collage on one side and lyrics on the other.
Despite being an expensive double album, 
 was a huge seller. It entered the UK chart at number one and remained there for a total of eight of the 22 weeks it was listed. In the USA, it topped the charts of nine weeks and stayed in the album chart for an initial run of 65 weeks. As with 
Sgt. Pepper
, no singles were released from 'The White Album' in the UK and USA during the sixties.
Amid the sessions for 
, the animated film 
Yellow Submarine
 was given it's UK premier on 17th July. The soundtrack LP featured four new Beatles songs and was in the shops eight weeks after the release of

(oh, sorry!)
Running to and fro, hard
Working at the mail
Never fail
Get the mail
Yeah, some rotten deal
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to invite them again
Say me
Talking to me
Tryin' to run me up a creek
She used to buy one
Try to pay me again next week
Long-haired, good-looking
Trying to get me hooked
Or me to marry
Settle down
Get the horn by the bull
Mediocre money
Being fighting in the hall
Army bunk, army go
Army chow, army cook
Same thing every day
Getting up, going to school
No need to make complaining
My objection's overruled
Working in the filling station
Too many tires
Wipe the windows
Check the tire
Check the oil and all the gas
Don't want your moderation, get away, leave me
I found it out, what love is all about
And every day, it sure lets out
I see my baby, I get weak in the knees
'Cause nothin's shakin' but the leaves on the tree
My papi told me there'd be times like these
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
We meet the gang and go to rockin' Joe's
The cats are something on the heels and toes
I grab my baby, tried to give her a squeeze
Well why must she be such a dog-gone tease?
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spent my money, then she plays me cool
I'm beggin' for her kisses on a bended knee
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin', baby
Please, please, please
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
Till that time, she puts my heart at ease
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees, yeah
Crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back
I just can't seem to get you off my mind
You're the one I love, I think about you all the time
Crying, do do do do, tear keep a falling all night long
Waiting, do do do do, it seems so useless I know it's wrong
Keep a crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back
Maybe someday soon it'll change and you'll be mine
Lay of them blue suede shoes
But lay of them blue suede shoes
From a old fruit jar
And don't you step
On my blue suede shoes, please
Ah go, hit it, Carl (Perkins)!
Blue Suede shoes
Blue blue blue
 The next few minutes, we're in the lap of the gods and the hands of the Beatles In my young days, when I was a lad, they used to have actors in films and now that they--
 Yes?
 Hey! Listen!
 It's all changed, now, Brian They're not doing that, no actors
 It's all changed, now
 But this is what I wonder In those days, the actors used to say their best bits were left on the cutting room floor, did you find that?
 No, no, no, those were the good bits in the film You should have seen the rest
 Rubbish!
 Was it, really?
 Even worse, yes
 Who was worst?
 Oh, Paul
 I see
 I think John was about the worst
 No, it was you
 Oh, Ringo was very good, he was, he's a good lad
 He was. They're saying he's a new Charlie Chaplin Do you think that's right?
 He was miming
 You, too, with Jason
 Oh, yes, he's an old one. Okay, Ring?
 Beginning to look like that Now, then--
 All right, John. Can you hear me?
 Can you hear him? Hello!
 Not really I hope not I hope not!
 We brought you the flowers, Ring
 He's not allowed to talk
 Eh?
 We brought you the flowers
 Oh, good
 And the grapes
 Oh, I like grapes
 He likes grapes
 We've been to Portugal
 Guess who's, guess who's top of the pops in Portugal, then
 Who?
 Los Beatles
 Los Beatles? Great, great laugh
 I don't suppose you know the title of your film in Portuguese?
No Crinsk dee Night
?
 Could be, let's hear the number, shall we?
 Right
And kiss me tonight
We are together now
And forever, come my way
Joe Prairies and the Prairie Wallflowers
Los Paranoias invites you to

Only "Pet Sounds" tops this. See you in 2200 and  this will still be relevant
 But despite the fact that the next request comes from Anton, 32
Perry Road, Sherwood, in Nottingham, it's headed "Up the Pool" and starts
"Dear Wack!" So, John, you take it from there
 "Dear Wack! Please, ask those gorgeous lads," ha, ha," called the Beatles
To sing 'You Really Got a Hold on Me' for Di, Gus, Wizz, and me, also for the
Beatles, themselves, especially Paul," ha, "and everybody that was in the Roy
Orbison Tour. I'm a regular listener of 'Pop Go the Beatles,'" good lad, "and
Please, tell the boys that all the girls in our office think it is a fab show
Thank you"
 All right, stop the band. Oh, that's splendid and now, what are you
Going to sing for us?
 "You Really Got a Hold on Me...Mother"
Well
Be-bop-a-lula she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula she's...
My baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll
She's the one in the red blue jeans
She's the queen of all the team
She's the woman walkin' that I know
She's the woman that loves me so
She's the woman who's got that beat
She's the woman with the flying feet
She's the woman walk around the store
She's the woman gives me more more more
Oh, well, I'm sittin' here, la, la
Waiting for my ya ya
Uh huh, uh huh

It may sound funny
But I don't believe she's comin'
Baby, honey, don't leave me worried
Er, baby, honey, er, don't leave me worried
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
We said that our love was just fun
The day that our friendship begun
Well theres no blue moon that I can see
Theres ever been in history
Because our love was just fun
Well theres no blue moon that I can see
Because our love was just fun
Just Fun, Just Fun, Just Fun...
 Now, for the final number, John's got a card in his hand with a little rhyme on it. What is it?
 It's from the form up a third at Hemel Hempstead
 Oh!
 It says, "Dear George, John, Ringo, Paul, here's hoping that you'll please us all
A beauty song and swinging voice, we leave it up to you, the choice
We think you're fab and really cool, so brighten up our lads at school"
Dig this, for here's Paul, whistling "Clarabella"
Ooh! My soul
Well baby baby baby baby
Don't you know my love is true?
Honey honey honey honey

Love love love love
Well give me give me give me give me give me
Give me all the love you got

Far far away
And there ain't no fish to be caught
No fish to be caught
There ain't no sea
The council came
Away from me

A big mac, a big hat
Some socks, a pair of wellingtons
And a bit of wine

Are you gonna be in my dreams, tonight?
Love you, love you, love you, love you
And in the end the love you take
I'm gonna search this town
From door to door
Love I crave
I can't find no more
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
You know I hate to see the sun
Sinking to the west
'Cause I know my whole life's
Gonna be one solid mess
Well ever since the day
That she said we were through
I've been nervous
And shook up too
Well I don't care if the last thing
I ever do in my life
I wanna find that little woman
Make her my wife
Here we go again
Here we go again and again
Wond'rin’ how it all began
Wond'rin' will it ever end
Round and round we go
Where it’s going, nobody knows
Though I know we've been this place before
Someone keeps on moving the door
Here we go agai-ai-ai-ain
Here we go agai-ain
So I say hello again
And nobody gives a damn
And nobody wants to hold your hand
Ev'ryone is an also-ran
Where it's going, nobody knows
Though I know we've seen this place before
Round and round we go-oh-oh-oh
Round and round we go-oh
Gentlemen, hello
I'm just sitting here reminiscing
Wondering who you've been kissing, baby, oh oh baby
I've been wandering all around
There must be a new guy in town
You don't love me anymore
I'll get over you, baby
Although my heart's still sore
You know my heart's still sore
Well, I think of all the lies you told
You're a junk man, my heart you sold
You're a cheater and a mean mistreater
When I think of all the fun we had
Kind of makes me feel so sad
And I'm lonely for your love and as long as I live
It's only you I'll be thinking of
It's you I'm thinking of
Mein Herz ist bei dir nur, my darling
Mein Herz fand bei dir nur das Glück
Noch trennen uns Länder und Meere
Doch bald kehre ich wieder zurück
Well, my Bonnie lies over the ocean
Yeah, bring back my Bonnie to me
Yeah, bring back, ah, bring back, (now)
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me, to me
Oh, bring, oh bring back (now), ah, bring back
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me
Whoa!
Ah! ho! ho! ho!
Ah! go! go! go! go!
Ho! ho! ho!
Go! go! go!
Oh ho! oh ho!
(I know) Well, my Bonnie lies over the ocean
(I know) Yeah, bring back, (now) ah, bring back
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me, to me. (now)
Oh, bring back, (now) ah, bring back
Ho! Bring back my Bonnie to me
 But now, John has his work cut out on the next one
As he takes his guitar on and off his neck and pulls the harmonica in and out of his face
 Harp. It's a harp
 What? Harp?
 The harp. Because I'm playing the harp on this one
 Playing the harp?
 Harmonica I play on "Love Me Do," harp, on this one, little goes in the orange
 But it goes in and out? Do you want to do this announcement?
Well, go on, you go ahead, no, it's all right. Tell them. Tell them about the next song
 Oh, er, we'd like to carry on with Chuck Berry's "I Got to Find My Baby"
Don't know where she's been, pardon, hello? Love these goon shows
 George, is it true you're a connoisseur of the classics?
 No, it's just a rumor
 It's just a rumor
 A rumor, mmm
 Do you enjoy singing Beethoven?
 No, been singing it for 28 years now, y'know
 For how long?
 28 years
 That's incredible, could you manage one more performance?
 Um, possibly
 Oh go on, say yes
 Yes. Thank you
You're a stranger in my arms
When i saw you standing there
Without a wooly ho i hair
I want it so much
And me on a road somewhere
When the lights are very low
And the sky is on the celing
And there's no one there to know
Oh its gone off
The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know
The many ways I've tried
But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
I'm sure to fall
Fall in love
You are so sweet
And so near
Darling, don't ever let me go
Loving you
Is the natural thing to do

When I was sitting on my piano one day
A magical thought came my way
To write a number for the BBC
Kenny Everett McCartney
All together on the wireless machine
Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot
A day or two ago, the story I must tell
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead
Too bad about sorrows
Too bad about love
There'll be no tomorrow
For all of your love
You said you were sleeping
But I can't forget
The troubles you're leaving
Don't be like that
Feeling two foot small
Hey you've got to hide your love away
How can I even try?
"Love will find a way?"
(German)
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another (Ooh)
Well, my heart went "boom" when I crossed that room
Well, we danced through the night, and we held each other tight
Oh, we danced through the night, and we held each other tight
Come along now
Put all those toys away
It's time to jump into bed
And go off into dreamland
Yes, Daddy will sing a song for you
Are you ready?
Now don't ask me why
Now the sun
Uh, oh dear, hold on
Daddy, daddy went a bit crazy
Daddy
This is the fourth by the four. 'Please, Please Me', 'With The Beatles', 'Hard Day's Night'. That's three. Now...'Beatles For Sale'.
The young men themselves aren't for sale. Money, noisy though it is, doesn't talk that loud. But you can buy this album - you probably have, unless you're just browsing, in which case don't leave any dirty fingerprints on the sleeve!
It isn't all currency or current though. There's priceless history between the covers. None of us is getting any younger. When, in a generation or so, a radio-active, cigar-smoking child, picnicking on Saturn, asks you what The Beatles affair was all about - ;Did you actually know them?'- don't try to explain all about the long hair and the screams! Just play the child a few tracks from this album and he'll probably understand what it is all about. The kids of AD 2000 will draw from this music much the sam sense of well being and warmth we do today.
For the magic of The Beatles is, I suspect, timeless and ageless. It has broken all frontiers and barriers. It has cut through differences of race, age, and class. It is adored by the world.
This album has some lovely samples of Beatles music. It has, for instance, eight new titles wrought by the incomparable John Lennon and Paul Mccartney, and mingling with the new, there are six numbers culled from the rhythmic wealth of the past extraordinary decade; pieces like Kansas City, and Rock and Roll Music. Marvelous.
Many hours and hard day's nights of devoted industry went into the production of this album. It isn't a potboiling quick-sale any-old-thing-will-do-for-christmas mixture.
At least three of the Lennon-Mccartney songs were seriously considered as single releases until John popped up with I Feel Fine. These three were Eight Days A Week, No Reply and I'm A Loser. Each would have topped the charts, but as it is they are an adornment to this LP, and a lesson to other artists. As on other albums, The Beatles have tossed in far more value than the market usually demands.
There are few gimmicks or recording tricks, though for effect, The Beatles and their recording manager George Martin have slipped in some novelties. Like Paul on Hammond organ to introduce drama into Mr. Moonlight, which also, and for the first time, has George Harrison applying a thump to an elderly African drum because Ringo was busy elsewhere in the studio, playing bongos. George's thump remains on the track. The bongos were later dropped. Ringo plays timpani in Every Little Thing, and on the Rock and Roll Music track George Martin joins John and Paul on one piano. On Words of Love, Ringo plays a packing case.
Beyond this, it is a straightforward 1964 disc-making. Quite the best of it's kind in the world. There is little or nothing on the album that cannot be reproduced on stage, which is, as students and critics of pop-music know, not always the case.
Here it is then. The best album yet-quite definitely, says John, Paul, George, and Ringo-full of everything which made the four the biggest attraction the world has ever known. Full of raw John and Melodic Paul; a number from George, and a bonus from Ringo. For those who like to know who does exactly what, there are details alongside each title.
Let me find you a place
Who cares of the day
Will be carried away
By the smile
On your face
Now and forever
Come my way
And stay
You look tired love
Rest your head
On my shoulder
And love me tonight
I'll always be here
If you should need me
Night and day
When you leave me say
You'll see me again
For I'll know in my heart
We will not be apart
And I'll miss you till them
We'll be together now
And forever
Since we kissed I never knew the thrills I could have tasted
Since we kissed I never knew the years that I was wasting
But now I know I was waiting
For you to come by, I was waiting girl, won't you please tell me why it took so long to begin
Darling where have you been all my life?
Oh don't you know that until we touched I never knew the touch was of revealing
Until we touched I never knew my heart was really beating
But now I know I was waiting
For you to come by, I was waiting girl, won't you please tell me why it took so long to begin
Darling where have you been all my life
Oh where you've been, where you've been
Now don't you know I was waiting
Where have you been, where you've been, where you've been, when I was feeling blue
Where have you been, where you've been, where you've been, when I was needing you
Where you've been
You can dance
Every dance with the guy
Who gave you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the man
Who held your hand
'Neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, mmm
Oh I know
That the music is fine
Like sparkling wine
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing
But while we're apart
Don't give your heart
To anyone
Baby don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, never let you go
I love you oh so much
Go and carry on
Till the night is gone
And it's time to go
If he asks
If you're all alone
Can he take you home
You must tell him no
Cause don't forget who's taking you home
Save the last dance for me
Ready - set - go man go
I got a gal that I love so
I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready ready ready to rock 'n' roll
Goin' down to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock 'n' roll baby, she's the apple of my eye (chorus)
Well, the flat top cats and the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint is really jumpin', the cats are goin' wild
The music really sends me, I dig that crazy style (chorus)
Gonna kick off my shoes, roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock 'n' roll baby, pour on the steam
I shuffle to the left, I shuffle to the right
Gonna rock 'n' roll 'til the early early night
What goes on in your mind
The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
I used to think of no one else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
Whispering words of wisdom
Let it be (let it be)
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Malcolm comes to me
Let it be
Let it be (yeah)
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be (
Should we do one with just a slide solo?
Whisper words of wisdom (
Okay, roll it Ken, roll it
Make a note of this one, because this is the one
Cans on, Eric
All you can  anyhow
I see my baby, I get weak in the knees
'Cause nothin's shakin' but the leaves on the tree
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I've loved you from the moment, I saw you
You looked at me that's all you had to do
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too
I really love you

Well I said shake, rattle, and roll

"Now George always gets his fair share at west cards, but this one is really funny, would you read it out George?"
"It says, do you like the flowerpot man?
And I think
Rodney Burke: I've got one card here and it's on the same subject, eh, but this one says, "We think the show is great and we dig the Beatles the most, but we still haven't heard a word from Ringo yet."
Ringo: Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!
Rodney: "And how about him singing?" Well, what will you sing for us, Ringo? Will you say a few words?
Ringo: Hello, there, kiddies. I'd like to sing a song for you today called "Matchbox." There you go
Rodney: Set fire to that lot. Okay, Ringo, thanks very much
Ringo: Don't you et smart with me, you know
Rodney: Do you mind? Get over to your microphone, "Matchbox."
Down in Eastern Australia
I met her
She was wearing a red blue sweater
I asked her who knitted the sweater
She said never mind
Alan Freeman: George, is it true that you're a connoisseur of the classics?
George: No, it's just a rumour, a rumour
Alan: Just a rumour?
George: Hmm
Alan: Did you enjoy singing "Beethoven"?
George No. Been singing it for 28 years, now, you know
Alan: For how long?
George: Twenty-eight years
Alan: That's incredible. Could you manage one more performance?
George: Um, possibly
Alan: Oh, go on, say, "yes."
George: Yes, thank you
Long distance information
Give me Memphis, Tennessee
Try to find the party
Trying to get in touch with me
She would not leave her number
But I know who placed the call
'cause my uncle took the message
And he wrote it on the wall
Help me, information
Get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here
From Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side
Just beyond the ridge
Just a half a mile
From the Mississippi Bridge
More than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her
And all the fun we had
We were pulled apart
Because her mom would not agree
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee
The last time I saw Marie
She was waving me goodbye
With hurry homedrops on her cheek
That trickled from her eyes
Marie is only six years old
Information please
Roll up, roll up for the magical mystery tour
Step right this way
Wo, wo, I never realized what a kiss could be
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
Whoa
I think it's today, yeah
She's got a ticker to ride
Do
Did you have to treat me oh so bad
Tell me what and I'll apologise
If you don't really can't go on
Cos I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you
 That was a, a Little Richard number that the boys rather like and hope you liked it, "Ooh! My Soul." And, ooh, my arms! We've, we've just flown in to Manchester here from London to record this show. Ha, ha. Well, it's, ha, ha, it's good to see you again, fellers, in these, er, foreign parts. How are you?
 Very well, thank you
 Oh, great!
 Oh, great, yeah, it's just fine
 Well, what are you doing at the moment, by the way?
 Ah, we're playing in Liverpool at the moment and we've never been there months, you see, so it's--
 It's good to be back
 Yeah, it's great!
 Anybody over there like a request that you can do right now?
 Well, we'll do a request for everybody
 Good, what do you suggest?
 Er, "Don't Ever Change," one of the oldies
We are traveling in the footsteps
Of those who've gone before
But we'll all be reunited (but if we stand reunited)
On a new and sunlit shore (then a new world is in store)
Oh lord I want to be in that number
And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
When the moon turns red with blood
On that hallelujah day
Oh when the trumpet sounds the call
Some say this world of trouble
Is the only one we need
But I'm waiting for that morning
When the new world is revealed
When the revelation (revolution) comes
When the rich go out and work
When the air is pure and clean
When we all have food to eat
When our leaders learn to cry
Geh weg! (raus!) Geh weg! (raus!)
Geh weg! (raus!) nach eine Nacht, nach Haus
Geh weg, geh raus
Geh raus nach irgendeinem Haus
Geh rach (rasch?) nach Haus
Ja, check it
Ja, geh weg, check it
Das war nicht so gut!
Geh weg! Geh weg!
Geh raus nach deinem, deinem Haus
Geh weg! Geht raus!
Geht raus nach irgendeinem Haus!
Geht raus nach deinem Haus!
Ja, das ist gut , check it
Unsagbar gut, ja!
Und Loretta Martin denkt, sie war ein Freundliche
Ja aber das war nicht wär so
So, sie sagt nach  diesem Bild, (your name is?)/ (you be my?) (you remain) rötlich
Ja des werd ich gar nicht rot
Geh raus, geh raus
Geh raus nach deinem munding Haus!
Geh raus, geht raus
Geh raus nach deinem freundlich Haus!
Geht raus, Loretta!
Geh raus nach deinem Haus! Joah!
Vielen Dank für die Blumen (Blümen)

INTERVIEWER: Do you think the bug has bitten now? Are you guys – do you have big eyes now to be actors?
PAUL: No.
GEORGE: Not really, no. We still, you know, even if our film – this, A Hard Day’s Night – is the biggest box office attraction ever, you know, it still won’t make us feel as though we’re actors. But I think we’d all enjoy making a new film.
RINGO: Yeah, it’s good fun. I think the next one we make will be more fun, because we’ve sort of got the hang of things. Like on this one, when we first started, when we’re not supposed to look at the camera, you’d always sort of find yourself turning ‘round and smiling at it.  You’d just smile as soon as you saw the camera, you know.
PAUL: And on this one, I don’t know whether this happens on lots of films, we used to keep breaking up giggling.
RINGO: Yeah.
PAUL: We had some great giggling fits, you know. We’d sort of say a line, and I kept doing it a particular way. There was one line I kept saying to Ringo, it’s about the grandfather in the film who goes off to—
RINGO: Well, we can’t tell you, ‘cause we’ll ruin the film, you see!
PAUL: We can’t tell you  but it was just this one thing where the grandfather goes off to a club, and I was supposed to say to Ringo “It’s all your fault” and things. ‘Cause in the film actually, although it’s not true in real life, we sort of pick on Ringo a bit, you know, because it was obvious really, because he’s sort of smaller and it looks funny in the film. But I’m supposed to be picking on Ringo and saying “It’s all your fault” and things. And as I was saying it, I’m a bit – I kept flapping my arms up and down, I don’t know why, I must have thought I was a good actor!  And I was just sort of flapping around and saying, “It’s all your fault!”  Flapping my arms around, and he couldn’t stand it, he was giggling away. So then I started laughing, and we just collapsed, and we took so many takes on that bit.
RINGO: Yeah, twelve takes on that bit.
PAUL: Yeah. And I think we cut that bit in the end or something. 
PAUL: They cut some of it.
RINGO: They cut half of it, yeah, but you know, a lot of laughs. All different things that happened were funny to us which, you know, they haven’t printed or put on the film, but it’s great when we go and see the film, then we can sort of say, “Remember that bit?” if they showed the one we did before, you know, where we all broke up.
Late yesterday night
I saw a light shine from a window
And as I looked again
Your face came into sight
I couldn't walk on
Until you'd gone from your window
I had to make you mine
I knew you were the one
Oh, I would be glad
Just to have a love like that
Oh, I would be true
And I'd live my life for you
So meet me tonight
Just where the light shines from our window
And as I take your hand
Say that you'll be mine tonight
Oh, I would be so glad
And I'd give my life for you
Edit Lyrics
Oh ain't she sweet?
Well see her walking down that street
Yes I ask you very confidentially
Ain't she sweet?
Oh ain't she nice?
Well look her over once or twice
Yes I ask you, very confidentially
Ain't she nice?
Just cast an eye
In her direction
Oh me, oh my
Ain't that perfection?
Oh I repeat
Well don't you think that's kind of neat?
Ain't she sweet?
Well see her walking down that street?
Oh ain't she nice?
Well look her over once or twice
Well I ask you, very confidentially
Albino-coloured glasses wearing knock-kneed shoes
Seventh church is on his head its on-headed glue
Sales in the morning, it's a case of the blues oh oh oh
Albino-coloured glasses shooting knock-kneed shoes
Second pair of dockers sang inside of a hood
This is the morning, a case of the blues
This is the morning, it's a case of the blues
Sammy tries to bargain with a celephant jew
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues
Driving pair of lincoln sandals, sham leather shoe
Albino-coloured glasses looking back-kneed shoes
Come together, sell a gender, it's pleasant to choose
So watch it
She took off
So long
Albino-coloured glasses with a knock-kneed shoe
Merry chives departed down the celephant jew
Alabaster primrose, i'm sad and i'm blue
And everyone knows it's a case of the blues
It's okay to leave a dog in a hot car
I was thinking that I had it good
Beat my wife like I knew I should
Suddenly a spanner jams the cogs
She went and bought the family a dog
I was supposed to take him to the vet
I'll lock him in the car and watch him sweat
It's ok to leave your dog in a hot car
(As long as you don't look back)
As long as you leave the window closed
You'll always know
That nothing bad can possibly happen
The doors locked tight
And he's out of sight
So go and leave your dog in the car
Today's only 35 degrees
So leave the mutt in the limousine
Roll the windows up so he stays warm
A little sunlight nеver caused no harm
Just make surе there isn't any doubt
The last thing that I need's him getting out
It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
As long as you tell the passers by
He'll be alright
Then nothing bad can possibly happen
Now it's all over
For dear old rover
Mr. Willy and his big fat hands
Are gonna slap your mummy's glands
Until the cows come home
And all the girls and boys
Who don't like any noise
Are gonna send the word by phone
Everything's the same
But they don't know who to blame
When their life's a custard pie
And everybody in it's
Gotta get a sharper wit
To see the faces in the sky
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
It's Ringo who sang the ahs
And Ringo I shagged your wife
Keep Clapton away from mine
 I warn you with peace and love
 It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
 Please give me my biscuits back
It's okay to leave a car in a hot dog
 But two of us don't eat meat
It's okay to leave a dog in YOUR FACE
Gave you them whiskey eyes
Those California dreaming nights
I never thought we’d be this high
We’re dancing side by side
And she drinking on the lime
Her heart can lie tonight
She holding onto mine
The feelings won’t subside
I don’t know why
It feels like, it feels like
I don't know what to feel like
But I know that it feels right
It feels like, it feels like
I don't know what to feel like
We’re dancing side by side
Now we drunk in love tonight
Staring at the sky
The stars a passing by
Don’t you let me try
If it’s just this one time
Good evening, and welcome to Slaggers
